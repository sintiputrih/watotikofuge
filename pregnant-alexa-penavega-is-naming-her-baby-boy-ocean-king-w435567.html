Pregnant <a href=#><b>Alexa PenaVega</b></a> and her husband, <b>Carlos PenaVega</b>, announced the sex of their baby via Instagram on Sunday, August 21. Even more, they told fans what they would be naming their first child — and it's a very unique moniker.</p><p>"Ocean King PenaVega. We can't wait to meet this little Blessing. #BabyPenaVega #MyLilMan," the <i>Spy Kids</i> actress, 27, captioned a sonogram photo.</p><p>After some confusion among commenters, she clarified that, yes, Ocean is the name they've chosen for their baby boy. "(For those asking about our name choice…) – God called the dry ground 'land' and the water the 'seas.' And God saw that it was good," she wrote, referring to Genesis 1:10. "That is why we went with Ocean. And he is a son of the one true 'King.' For us it has a beautiful biblical meaning."</p><p>Alexa has been <a href=#>posting pics of her growing baby bump</a> quite frequently since she announced her pregnancy. Last week, she hinted at Ocean's name while vacationing with Carlos. "We can't get enough of the ocean!!!" she captioned an Instagram pic of the two sunbathing. "Can't wait for all the adorable mini bathing suits we get to pack next year!!! #PenaVegaCruise."</p><span class=caption></span><p>The couple, who both appeared on season 21 of <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>, <a href=#>revealed in June that they were expecting</a> their first child together.</p><p>"There is going to be a new cool kid in town… And by cool I mean dorky just like their father," the <i>Big Time Rush</i> rocker, 27, captioned an Instagram pic of the parents-to-be at the time. "A little PenaVega is on the way!!! #ItsHappening #HolyWow #Imgoingtobeadaddy."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The stars got engaged in September 2013 and <a href=#>married four months later in Mexico.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aYpZ2olnqxsc2arZ6fkWK2tHnNmqSippditaa%2BjJuYm7Fdl7y6ec6cnJqmXaC2r7OMsGtsbWVrhHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
