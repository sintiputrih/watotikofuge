Taylor was widely known and recognized in the music industry after recording eight studio albums with his band between the years 1989 and 2021. In total, Foo Fighters have taken home 12 Grammy awards and snagged four No. 1 hits on the Billboard charts since getting started.</p><p>Taylor was one of the reasons why the band was so successful and beloved. Here’s what Taylor‘s fans should know about the wife and kids he leaves behind.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Taylor Hawkins' wife?</h2><p>Taylor and his wife, Alison Hawkins, got married in 2005. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meaww</a>, their wedding ceremony took place in Hidden Hills, Ca. Alison was a partner to Taylor in his music career before his death. As of now, she hasn’t posted an obituary or statement for her late husband, presumably taking time to grieve in private.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do we know about Taylor's children?</h2><p>Together, Taylor and Allison shared three children: Oliver, Annabelle, and Everleigh. Before Taylor's death, he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Daly</a> about a couple of songs he’d written for his kids. In regards to the song he wrote for Oliver, he said, “I had this song for my son. It’s a sweet song … It got all the way to possibly being on the record."</p><p>He continued, "So I played it for my son, and he goes, 'If you put that on your record, I’m gonna punch you in the face!' He was like, 'If you’re gonna write a song about me, it’s gotta sound like Metallica! I don’t want some wimpy a--, p---y song about me, dad!'"</p><p>He also talked about the song “Middle Child," which he wrote for his daughter Annabelle. Honoring and being there for his family was obviously something incredibly important to Taylor before his passing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ffPHhUKRT4</a></p>— Foo Fighters (@foofighters) <a href=#>March 26, 2022</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@foofighters</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What exactly happened to Taylor Hawkins — and what was his net worth?</h2><p>Taylor’s death was confirmed on March 25, 2022 when the official Foo Fighters Twitter page <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a statement</a>, which says, “The Foo Fighters family is devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of our beloved Taylor Hawkins.
