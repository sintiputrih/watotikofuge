In the video, Adrian finds a dollar stuck under a grate. When he lifts the grate, he sees even more cash and a bag filled with a strange collection of objects.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Adrian finds a book filled with cash, an unlabeled bottle of medication, and a wallet.

That’s a paper route. Lol they’ll find it,” one person commented.

But here’s a breakdown of what the term means, for any curious minds.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is “paper route” money?</h2><p>The internet is in shambles after Adrian took home the cash and other items that he found in the middle of nowhere. TikTok users believe Adrian stumbled across a “paper route,” and could be in danger if he does not return the money.</p><p>“My guyyyy put that back and delete this is this is legit, they will legit find you,” one person warned. But some, including Adrian, have no idea what the fuss is all about. And while it’s unclear if Adrian is truly in any danger, a paper route is not something he would want to interrupt.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Dictionary</a>, a paper route is a “place where a dealer sells drugs from.” However, a paper route can refer to any location where an exchange of items is done secretly.</p><p>Also referred to as a dead drop, paper routes limit the chances of being caught as there is never a physical exchange of goods. One party will drop off the products, and the other will return at a later point to retrieve the package.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adrian was questioned by the police and is safe and sound.</h2><p>Adrian provided an update on his paper route debacle on September 27, and he appeared to call the police for help. In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, Adrian first returns the items to the hole covered by the grate. He later received a visit from police, who questioned him about the bag filled with cash.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Adrian told the officers that he returned the items and even provided his recordings as evidence. The officers checked the hole, but the bag was gone. Adrian was then asked to give the officers the sneakers he wore when he discovered the items.</p><p>However, the story does not end there. Adrian later got a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">note</a> in the mail requesting he return the $50 that was missing from the paper route bag, and he did so without hesitation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmaokaWys3nRqKytnV2ivK%2Bx2A%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
