Dozens of others agreed that the girls were nothing short of gorgeous.</p><p>The public got wind of the arrival of Ashley and ex-boyfriend Musiq Souldchild’s newborn last November. “Introducing: Satori Solaris,” Ashley shared online. “Born: Oct 30, 2017, Weight: 6 lbs 14 oz Height: 20 inches — Born right into papa’s (@musiqsoulchild) hands.” More than 45,000 social media fans liked the post and dozens gave their well wishes.</p><p>Musiq Soulchild and Ashley Wright ended their relationship just one month after she announced their expectancy of a child. <a href=# rel=noopener>Wright took to social media</a> to express her feelings after moving out of her ex-boyfriend’s home.</p><p>“It was a year, I had met him, he woo’d me, we moved in together, we started a family (holds belly), and I would for the first time celebrate Mother’s Day with a companion by my side,” Wright shared last May. “I pictured holding hands, and belly rubs, me planning a cute meal of sorts (he isn’t the celebration type) and laughs at Shannon’s joyful, playful ways.— Yet here I am, at my parent’s house, in a bed that gives me lower back pain, consistently shifting my mind as I courageously take on emotions and feelings that do not serve me. — I replayed how I had to pack up all of my belongings alone, and moments In which I cried on the stairs.”</p><p>Little Satori is Ashley Wright and Musiq Souldchild’s only child. Wright has two kids in all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kHFmaWpfZ31wudSsoKplo6TCra%2FHoqOdq12axW6zyKujn6qZmrulecinq6unlKqwpr%2BMrZ%2BeoaJisaLBxqGrnqpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
