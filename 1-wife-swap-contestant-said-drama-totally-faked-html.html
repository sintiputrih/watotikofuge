The show’s premise involved two women from different backgrounds moving into each other’s homes and living with their new families for two weeks.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_37>Cameras followed each family as the “new wife” tried to make changes in the new home and sometimes changed herself. In the end, the wives moved back with their families, who often learned from their new experiences.</p><h2 id=h-was-wife-swap-fake>Was ‘Wife Swap’ fake?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_17>Many reality shows are said to be at least partially fake, and Wife Swap&nbsp;may be no different.</p><p id=par-4_49>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BuzzFeed</a>, one user reported, “My sister was on an episode of Wife Swap.
