She has received widespread acclaim for her roles in both indie and mainstream movies, particularly historical dramas. She acted in various films and television shows during the course of her more than three decades-long acting career. The Curse of the Black Pearl, Pride & Prejudice, Atonement, The Imitation Game, and other Pirates of the Caribbean titles. In terms of her private life, she is a mother. Caleb Knightley, Keira Knightley’s brother, is the subject of today’s story.</strong></p><h2><span id=Caleb_Knightley_Who_Is_He_Age_Differences_And_Family_Of_Keira_Knightley8217s_Brother>Caleb Knightley: Who Is He? Age Differences And Family Of Keira Knightley’s Brother</span></h2><p>Actress Keira Knightley’s older brother is Caleb Knightley. Parents Will Knightley and Sharman Macdonald gave birth to the Knightley siblings. Her brother was born in 1979, while Keira was born on March 26, 1985. Since the actress is 38 years old and her older sibling is 44 as of 2023, there is a six-year age difference between the two siblings.</p><p>The brother-sister team also has a strong relationship. They often show up in public together. The actress from Silent Night served as a bridesmaid in Caleb’s wedding at the beginning of 2011. In a purple above-the-knee bridesmaid dress with a V-neckline and shoulder ties, she looked gorgeous.</p><p>In contrast, Keira’s sister-in-law sported a cream-colored outfit with long sleeves that was reminiscent of 1950s fashion. Their father is of English ancestry, while Caleb and Keira’s mother is of Scottish and Welsh ancestry. Will Knightley, their father, is a well-known actor with more than forty roles to his name. On the other side, after giving up performing, their mother worked as a writer.</p><p>The birth of Keira’s older brother left their parents in a dire financial situation. The “middling” actor Will Knightley would only agree to have a second kid if her mother first sold a screenplay. They were successful in varied degrees.</p><h2><span id=Also_an_actor_is_Caleb_Knightley>Also an actor is Caleb Knightley</span></h2><p>The Knightleys are an illustrious family. Like his sister and dad, Caleb Knightley works in the entertainment world as well. Caleb is a composer that has contributed to the sound design of several films, according to his IMDb biography. Steve, Come Here Today, Deflation, and The Continuing and Lamentable Saga of the Suicide Brothers are among the films for which the gifted composer Caleb is most known.</p><p>However, it looks that Keira’s older brother has changed his job. Since 2010, he has not worked on any projects. Caleb Knightley no longer often appears in public, therefore it is unknown what his current line of work is. I’d like to think that his career is doing well.</p><h2><span id=Meet_the_Married_Brother_of_Keira_Knightley_Kerry_Nixon>Meet the Married Brother of Keira Knightley, Kerry Nixon</span></h2><p>Caleb Knightley and his wife Kerry Nixon have a happy marriage. Kerry Nixon, Caleb Knightley’s wife, is a designer as of the 2011 report. The sister-in-law of the Pride & Prejudice actress has worked in the entertainment business. The 2001 short film Deflation included Kerry Nixon as a composer in the sound department.</p><p>Perhaps Kerry and Caleb came into contact while collaborating on the short film. Information concerning the children of the Knightley-Nixon couple has not yet been made public. Similar like Keira, the composer couple wants to live a private existence. On Instagram, the actress doesn’t seem to be very active. Keira, the star of The Imitation Game, wed James Rington, a British musician. Two kids were born to Knightley and Rington.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Notyourgothgirlfriend</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Medukarabu</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Lili Sixx</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Where Is Graham Dickason Now | Meet His Parents, Family And Ethnicity</a></h3>Graham Dickason is presently in the public eye after his wife, Lauren Dickason, was reported to have murdered their three daughters.
