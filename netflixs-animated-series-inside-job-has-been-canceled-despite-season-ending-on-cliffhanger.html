The adult animation <strong>Inside Job</strong> is the most recent show to feel the executioner‚Äôs blade as the show‚Äôs creator took to Twitter to confirm its expulsion amid rumors.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Inside Job is a workplace comedy-drama set at a secret government agency that kept things, well, secret. Lizzy Caplin voices socially awkward scientist Reagan Ridley as she deals with her misfit team whilst trying to make the world a better place. The show‚Äôs logline reads: ‚ÄúFor employees of the Deep State, conspiracies aren‚Äôt just theories ‚Äî they‚Äôre fact. And keeping them secret is a full-time job.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, unless it is picked up somewhere else, audiences won‚Äôt be able to see Inside Job progress any further as Netflix decided top pull the plug.

It had been announced back in June of 2022 that along with part two on the way, fans could expect to see a second season of Inside Job on the books, though that decision now appears to have been reversed, leaving fans upset and a little angry which is understandable given that season one ended on a cliffhanger.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=50 data-injectable=false>You can catch season one of Inside Job on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdOfo6Kwo2Kur7XMmquenF2osrO1xKxkoqajnrGmecmomWagkah6o7HEp2ScmZ6Ysq2xw2abnqugnsGmedKemKynnmKyr7DIp55mp55isK21xZ%2BfmqaXmr9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
