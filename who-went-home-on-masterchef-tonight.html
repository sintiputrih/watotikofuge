Each season, cooks from all across the country have gathered in the MasterChef kitchen in hopes of impressing <a href=#>Gordon Ramsay</a>, winning the title of one of America’s MasterChefs, and walking away with the $250,000 grand prize.</p><p>Season 13 has been extra special because the competition was split between chefs from four different regions of the U.S.: the West, the Northeast, the Midwest, and the South. Each week, the chefs battled it out to prove their home region superior.</p><p>So, who won MasterChef Season 13?

Jennifer set out to combine Southern food and flavors with French fine dining techniques, Grant called his approach “Italian heritage meets Midwest roots,” and Kennedy’s overall theme was “Self-Acceptance Through the Eyes of Nature.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kennedy came out on top in the appetizer round.</h2><p>First up was the Appetizer round. Jennifer served the judges Lobster Succotash with Sweet Corn Puree, Truffle Oil, and Champagne Caviar Vinaigrette. The judges liked the dish, although they agreed that it needed salt and might have benefited from a beurre blanc instead of the vinaigrette.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Grant’s appetizer was Ravioli al Uovo with Morel Cream Sauce, Truffle Butter, and Shaved Truffles. The judges were impressed by his technique and the dish’s flavor, although they said that he should have cooked the ravioli slightly longer so the egg wasn'Tht as runny.</p><p>Kennedy served Crispy Skinned Trout with Truffle Potatoes, Oyster Mushrooms, Tarragon Pea Puree, Saffron Touille, Trout Roe, and Smoked Oyster Aioli. The judges had a hard time finding anything to critique and said Kennedy had the strongest start in the competition.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Grant nailed his entrée portion.</h2><p>Grant served Pork Loin Medallions with Salmoriglio Sauce, Agrodolce, Celery Root Puree, and Beer-braised Fennel and Onions. The judges liked the dish; Gordon was particularly complimentary about the braised fennel.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kennedy’s striking entrée was Rabbit Saddle with Seared Rabbit Liver, Pickled Cherries, Beets, and Juniper Berry Sauce. The judges’ only critique was that the beets were slightly overpowering and could have been sliced thinner.</p><p>Jennifer made a Rack of Venison Persillade with Roasted Root Vegetables, Parsnip and Potato Puree, and Bordelaise Sauce. The judges said that she nailed the venison, although the sauce was slightly over-reduced and the vegetables were slightly undercooked.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jennifer wowed the judges with her dessert.</h2><p>Kennedy aimed to recreate the Colorado night sky with her dessert of Black Sesame Cake with Dark Chocolate Ganache, Blackberry Mousse, and Yuzu Chocolate Snow. While her dish was visually stunning, the cake itself was too dense and dry for the judges’ liking.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jennifer called her dessert an “I Love You” Cake — it was a Chocolate Raspberry Mousse Cake with Chambord Raspberry Coulis, Crystallized Raspberries, and Chocolate Mirror Glaze. The judges loved it and complimented Jennifer’s technique in making the layered mousse cake.</p><p>Grant’s dessert was a Torn Stout Cake with Coffee Stout Mousse, Chocolate Pizzelle, and Coffee Ice Cream. The judges were skeptical at first at his inclusion of beer in the dessert but were ultimately very impressed with how well everything worked together.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who won ‘MasterChef’ Season 13?</h2><p>At the end of the night, the judges worked together to determine whose three dishes came together to create the best menu.
