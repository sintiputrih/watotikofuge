This comes due to multiple allegations of transphobic comments, fan fiction with pedophilic undertones, and grooming allegations. This controversy is so bad that the franchise’s creator,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Scott Cawthon</strong></a>&nbsp;released a short statement on the situation.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A very long statement</a>&nbsp;was released by the r/fivenightsatfreddys subreddit’s head moderator u/Springpopo, which featured extensive details on the artist who goes by the name of LadyFiszi. It also shared links with timestamps to what this artist has said and done online.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>LadyFizi is an official artist for the&nbsp;Five Nights At Freddy’s series who drew the cover art for multiple Five Nights at Freddy’s books, graphic novels, and assets in a few FNAF games. Before working on Five Nights at Freddy’s, they were a popular FNAF fan artist and fan fanfiction writer, with works posted across Reddit and DeviantArt. Unfortunately, the artist was accused of multiple problematic actions online which eventually lead to the ban.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>The artist has a history of posting transphobic comments and has written fan fiction about the purple guy with pedophilic undertones. There were also accusations of grooming, which the artist denied aggressively multiple times through&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a variety of statements</a>. Other allegations made against LadyFiszi include tracing, ableism comments, and other negative and problematic interactions with the community.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>While the statement was met with support, there are a handful of LadyFiszi supporters who used horror author, Stephen King as an argument,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming that he wrote grotesque content involving kids</a>&nbsp;in his novel&nbsp;IT. However, what makes King and this fan artist different is that King doesn’t bring up that grotesque scene in everyday conversation. Not to mention, people knew the target audience of his novels and that FNAF has a much younger audience, hence why it LadyFiszi’s actions were frowned upon.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>Five Nights at Freddy‘s creator, Scott Cawthon left a short statement after the post was released. He has confirmed that LadyFiszi is no longer working for the franchise and that pedophilia and other grotesque content has “no place in the&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy‘s universe. This includes fan art and fan fiction content.” He finishes by wishing the artist the best in her future endeavors.</p><p>Hey everyone, I won’t write much about this here, but I will say that LadyFiszi no longer does artwork for Five Nights at Freddy’s. Sexual scenarios involving children are disgusting and grotesque in any form, including fan art and fan fiction, and have no place in the Five Nights at Freddy‘s universe. It is my understanding that she regrets this time in her life, and I wish her the best going forward.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>It’s currently unknown if Five Nights at Freddy‘s plans to hire a new artist or would be changing all the official arts and assets made by the artist. But one thing’s for certain, LadyFiszi has been permabanned from the subreddit and there are no plans to welcome her back. Also, she will no longer be working for the franchise anymore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZomKdln5uzqq%2FImqNmnpmrsm66yKCfratdlsFustGem52xo2Kus8DIrKtmoaNir6K6zZ6bZp6ipLpuwMeeZKydop6ytHnSrpmrnZSZtrV5xaijpaennruoecKopa2qn6uys7%2FYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
