Her career started in 1987.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Gong Li is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Li`s net worth is as high as $100 million, earned through her successful career in the entertainment industry.</p><h3>Gong Li Net Worth $100 Million</h3><p>Gong is a daughter of academic citizens; her father is a professor of economics, Gong Lize, while her mother, Liu Ying was a teacher. Li was raised in Jinan, alongside her four siblings. After finished high school, Li, wanted to enroll at one of the top music schools in China, however, she wasn`t accepted, and instead enrolled at the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing, finishing studies in 1989. Even before Li finished studies, she made her debut by appearing in the film “Red Sorghum” in 1987.</p><p>After graduation, she became more focused on acting, and soon made several appearances, including in “Quin yong”, “Xi tai hou” and “Dai hao mei zhou bao”. In 1990 she was cast in the lead role of Ju Dou in the film of the same name, alongside Wei Li and Baotian Li, and a year later firstly appeared in “God of Gamblers III: Back to Shanghai”, then starred in the Oscar-nominated “Raise the Red Lantern”, directed by <a href=#>Zhang Yimou</a>. Li continued to enjoy fame during the `90s, and landed several lead roles in such high profile films as “The Story of Qiu Ju” (1992), the Oscar-nominated “Farewell My Concubine” (1993), “A Soul Hunted by Painting” (1994), and again teamed up with <a href=#>Zhang Yimou</a>, this time for the film “To Live” (1994). All of these films, contributed to her net worth in a large degree, but her popularity would reach a whole new level with such films as “Chinese Box” (1997), next to <a href=#>Jeremy Irons</a>, “The Emperor and the Assassin” (1998), and in 2004 with Kar-Wai-Wong`s sci-fi romantic drama “2046”, which snatched numerous awards.</p><p>The next year she appeared in <a href=#>Rob Marshall</a>`s Oscar-winning drama “Memories of a Geisha”, starring <a href=#>Ziyi Zhang</a> and <a href=#>Ken Watanabe</a>, and then was the female lead in <a href=#>Michael Mann</a>`s “Miami Vice”, next to Collin Farrell and <a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a>, increasing further her net worth.</p><p>By 2010, even if she wanted Li couldn`t retreat from the scene, as she appeared in such famous films as “Curse of the Golden Flower” (2006), “Hannibal Rising” (2007), and “Shanghai” (2010), all of which added a solid amount to her already impressive net worth. However, for a few years her career began to decline, as she couldn`t find new engagements, but emerged once again on the scene in 2014, with the lead role in the drama film “Coming Home”, and most recently she had a role in the fantasy adventure “The Monkey King 2”.</p><p>Thanks to her skills, Li has won numerous prestigious awards, including the Golden Rooster and the Hundred Flowers Awards. Also, she received the Cannes Festival Trophy and Volpi Cup for Best Actress, among other awards.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Li Gong was in a relationship with director <a href=#>Zhang Yimou</a> during the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, and was then married to Singapore businessman Ooi Wei Ming from 1996 until 2010 with whom she has a daughter. Li also holds Singaporean citizenship, which she obtained in 2008.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=24.225663716814><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$100 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 31, 1965</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Shenyang, Liaoning China</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Film actress</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Central Academy of Drama</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Chinese</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Ooi Hoe Soeng (m. 1996–2010)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Mamoru Yoki Chung Li</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Gong Lize, Zhao Ying</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Siblings</td><td>Gong Gu, Gong Zheng, Gong Wen, Gong Di</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>巩俐 , Li Gong , Lei Gung , Gung Lee , Kung Lee</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000084/</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Awards</td><td>Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress, Golden Rooster Award for Best Actress, Hundred Flowers Award for Best Actress, Hundred Flowers Award for Best Supporting Actress, Volpi Cup for Best Actress</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nominations</td><td>Asian Film Award for Best Actress, National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actress, Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Drama</td></tr><tr readability=22><td>Movies</td><td>Curse of the Golden Flower, Coming Home, Memoirs of a Geisha, Ju Dou, Miami Vice, Raise the Red Lantern, Farewell My Concubine, Red Sorghum, To Live, Hannibal Rising, The Story of Qiu Ju, Shanghai Triad, The Monkey King 2, The Emperor and the Assassin, 2046, Flirting Scholar, Zhou Yu's Train, Chines...</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=27.8823117338><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=11><td>1</td><td>[on the differences in acting in Chinese vs. Hollywood films]: In terms of performance, it's not that different. Of course in terms of dialogue, there is a language difference, and this does make a difference. When I speak in English, my expressions become different. My attitude too. I'm not sure why, but there really is a difference. My hands move differently when I speak English. But in terms of performance, it's not that different. It won't be that because I'm in a foreign film that my approach is different. My training allowed me to make contact with a number of different possibilities. Four years in college let me work with excellent teachers who gave me a good foundation.</td></tr><tr readability=20.785166240409><td>2</td><td>[on <a href=#>Rob Marshall</a>]: The most extraordinary thing about Rob Marshall is the way he works. For one thing: he is always encouraging, always supportive. Whatever we do, he says "Perfect", "Elegant", "Very Good", etc. Even if you're not the best actress in the world, he will keep supporting and encouraging, so that you will feel like "oh my Gosh, I'm such a great actress, I can be a great actress!' And this really helped us a lot, because it really inspired us to give him our all. Every time we tried a scene, we would give him more and more. The other thing about Rob Marshall is his way of rehearsing. We rehearsed the whole film all the way through, from beginning to end, before we started shooting each scene. We had to memorize all the lines. They set up a simple set for us to practice and we ran our lines, adjusting some, so we knew what we were doing when we actually started filming it. We rehearsed the whole thing even before we split up the screenplay into shots, so we knew the whole script all the way through. This is something we just don't do in China. And it's very refreshing and different for me. And now I'm convinced this is a very good way to work.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>3</td><td>The important things are the script and the director. I have been waiting around to get the right script and the right director. For example, in the past if a Hollywood director came to me with a script and wanted me to play a character and she was a stereotypical Asian woman who gets into a fight and gets killed off quickly, that didn't seem to have much interest for me.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>4</td><td>The important thing for me when I look at characters is to consider the kind of constraints placed upon them. Now, me personally, I don't like to have a lot of constraints placed upon me. When you look at a script, of course, you look at a character and sometimes the character has to face situations that are very different from what you would like to face, or how you would like to react.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>5</td><td>For me the beauty of a person is a matter of the whole package. You have to look at the whole thing, not just a matter of outward appearance or whatever. It has to do with one's character, personality, upbringing and so on</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=29.150357995227><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>First Chinese actress/actor on the cover of TIME magazine.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>In 2010 Gong Li was presented with the "Commandeur of the Legion of Honor" the highest decoration from the French government.
