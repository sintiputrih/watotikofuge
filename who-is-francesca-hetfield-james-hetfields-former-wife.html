However, after she met James, her perspective changed because he treated her as an equal at home.&nbsp;</p><p>It was how he was brought up. Speaking about it, James said: “Our household is very 50/50. I think we should all be treated equally.”</p><p>James, who knows about his wife’s background, admitted that he finds it hard to respect a woman too timid to stand before men.&nbsp;He also confessed that he has a thing for strong women. No wonder he fell head over heels with Francesca, who always had a strong constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>She started working at an early age, holding down various jobs. She was a Metallica security crew member before becoming the band’s costume designer.</p><p>Outside fashion, other things Francesca likes include animals, especially cats. Her Instagram bio describes her as a “loyal, honest, mom, crazy cat lady.”&nbsp;Francesca enjoys posting pictures of her cats on her page, demonstrating her immense love for the long-haired felines.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_James_Hetfield_Meet_Francesca></span>How Did James Hetfield Meet Francesca?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Hetfield and Francesca Hetfield first met James in 1992, after which they started dating.&nbsp;James proposed to her when they decided to take things to the next step.

So, she went to the bathroom.&nbsp;When she returned, it was to meet the ring set on the table with James asking her to marry him. They <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in 1997.</p><p>After their marriage, James and Francesca mostly flew under the radar. However, they often toured together, and she even appeared in the 2004 documentary “Metallica: Some Kind of Monster.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Francesca_Hetfield_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Francesca Hetfield Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Francesca Hetfield is an American costume designer.
