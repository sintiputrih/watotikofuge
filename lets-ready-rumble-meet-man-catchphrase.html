His business venture is so successful, Buffer doesn't even have to say his catchphrase to make money. He makes more from the trademark than he does announcing in the ring.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">His catchphrase has brought Buffer more than just fame and fortune. It's also brought him family.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Raised by foster parents in Philadelphia, Buffer was re-united with his biological father and half-brothers in 1989 after his father saw him announcing on television. Buffer's half-brother Bruce is now his business partner and the announcer for the <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Ultimate Fight Championship </a>(UFC), <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>a mixed martial arts series</a>.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">But last year it nearly all came crashing down.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Buffer was diagnosed with <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>throat cancer</a>, the worst kind of disease imaginable for an announcer. His initial diagnosis required aggressive surgery and <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>chemotherapy</a>, which would almost certainly end his announcing career.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Buffer, however, got a reprieve. A second diagnosis called for a less invasive surgery that could potentially save his throat.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The surgery was a success, and today, Buffer is traveling the world again with his great voice and gangbuster trademark.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">ABC's John Berman recently sat down with the iconic announcer at his home near Los Angeles to discuss Buffer's legendary career.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><strong class=vtka>Berman</strong>: When someone says, 'Michael Buffer, what do you do for a living?,' how do you respond to that?</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><strong class=vtka>Buffer</strong>: I usually say sports announcer. Not broadcaster, but sports announcer.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><strong class=vtka>Berman</strong>: And what does that mean exactly?</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><strong class=vtka>Buffer</strong>: Well, primarily, of course, boxing ring announcer. But, you know, I've been blessed with -- that being parleyed into doing the introductions for World Series and NBA playoffs and Stanley Cup games and home openers of major sports and colleges. So, you know, I got to introduce a lot of guys.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><strong class=vtka>Berman</strong>: When you were growing up in, in Philadelphia, you said, 'I want to be the world's best-known introducer?'</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS"><strong class=vtka>Buffer</strong>: I had no clue that this would ever happen. I would watch the fights with my kids back in the early '80s, and a ring announcer in a fight announced the split decision. And he did it without the proper sequence, to give you the dramatic effect of -- 'and the winner by split decision,' pause, everybody waits and he gave away this -- the winner after two judges. And my oldest son said, 'Dad, you could do that.' And, and I thought, 'Well, yeah, OK. I'm a big fan. I can't afford a ticket, so maybe I could just get my way in to the ring that way.' And I came up with a sort of enhanced resume that said I had experience, and got my foot in the door and was quite terrible the first time. But I got another shot and it just took off, the power of television.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCTrHpmkJ2VoLKvsI6lnK2rXaeyorDYZqmupZKhsm65xJ6rZqWRo3qkrdOcn6mgopbApnvSraarsW%2BesX6Fj2tpcGhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
