But Kim Kyung Baek pushed himself past the limit to come number one in the first challenge of </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span>. This ultimately paralyzed his arm for two months!</span></p><p><span>Learn more about him as this Kim Kyung Baek Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Kim Kyung Baek, Netflix’s Physical 100 Contestant</b></h3><p><span>The awaited gameshow, Netflix’s </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span> premiered on January 24, 2023, and within a week it grabbed the No. 7 spot on Netflix’s top 10 TV shows list. Created by Jang Ho-gi, </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span> followed 100 contestants — including Kim Kyung&nbsp; — from various ethnicities, ages, and genders as they competed against each other to prove their physical strength.</span></p><p><span>“Fight to the death. Survive to the end.” These were the words that appeared in the show’s trailer. The contestants competed to survive purely with their physical strength.</span></p><p><span>In the first ep, Kyung and other contestants were placed in a massive space where plaster casts of their torsos sat on marble pedestals, arranged in concentric circles around a fountain. They then walked around, admiring each other’s plaster/actual bodies, objectifying and judging each other.</span></p><p><span>The show also radiated Squid Game vibes as assistants and safety personnel wore gray jumpsuits with most of their faces covered.</span></p><p><span>So, for the first challenge, the contestants were asked to hang on to a suspended apparatus lifted in the air. Later, based on how long they lasted, the players were then placed in order from 100 to 1, and in order, they got to choose who they’ll face in the first quest — a fight over a ball.</span></p><p><span>Kyung was the last man standing. But unfortunately, becoming number one came at a price. After hanging in the air for as long as they possibly could Kyung’s arm went “numb” and it was paralyzed for two months. Nevertheless, he had to continue to the next challenge for which he chose Nippert and lost!</span></p><p><span>Before the show premiered, Kyung took to his IG to write, “What kind of future the times will bring to the daily life of unemployed people.”</span></p><h3><b>Kim Kyung Baek Job</b></h3><p><span>Kim Kyung Baek is a former UDT Instructor – Underwater Drill Instructor. In the Korea Navy Special Warfare Flotilla, his job was to train, mentor, and lead UDT recruits in physical and mental preparation for combat missions.</span></p><p><span>“UDT/SEAL The name alone overwhelms everything. But what explanation do you need? A name that makes men’s blood run backward,” he said.</span></p><p><span>Recalling his time in the military, the star said that were many worse days. But being patient was the key. “Soldiers spend their entire lives preparing for a situation that may happen once,” he added.</span></p><p><span>It seems Kyung was honorably discharged from the military in 2021 after 2 ½ years of compulsory service and after almost 15 years of professional service. He started as a private soldier and ended his career as a sergeant.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After retirement, he said, “Soldier was my calling and everything. Now I am going to live another life.” And it could be that he’s joined the restaurant business in Gangnam, Nonhyeon-dong, Seoul. “Workers worry about what to eat during their lunch break. Is the price right? Is the value for money not cheap? Whether there is time to eat and drink coffee. Office workers who have a lot of worries,” he once explained his motivation.</span></p><p><span>As for his free time, Kyung spent it competing in fitness shows, going archery, camping, and climbing mountains. In fact, he climbed the Swiss Jungfrau at 3454m/11333ft in Dec 2013.</span></p><p><span>Also, Kyung was an avid cycler. But he only started cycling after visiting the US. There he did a 30 miles round trip from Seal Beach to Long Beach. Someday, he’d like to participate in the 23-year-old Nautica Malibu Triathlon.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> Back in 2018, he also did the Motiva Pink Challenge for breast cancer patients</span></p><h3><b>Kim Kyung Baek Height</b></h3><p><span>Kim Kyung Baek stands tall at a height of around 6 feet (183 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, Kyun has a fit body with the UDT Seal tattoo on his back.</span></p><h3><b>Is Kim Kyung Baek On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>As of February 2023, find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>udt_100</span></a><span> with 2.3K followers. Most of his posts then featured his time in the military or his fitness routines.</span></p><h3><b>Kim Kyung Baek Age</b></h3><p><span>Kim Kyung Baek was 42 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>He was one of the older contestants that season.</span></p><h3><b>Kim Kyung Baek Girlfriend</b></h3><p><span>Like most of his co-stars, Kim Kyung Baek kept his girlfriend a mystery.
