their real-life counterparts.</p><p>The new <a href=#>true crime</a> show, which comes out Thursday, tells the story of promising-turned-disgraced surgeon, Dr. Christopher Duntsch (played by Jackson), who was accused of maiming and killing his more than two dozed patients.</p><h2>Christopher Duntsch, aka Dr Death / Joshua Jackson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/ES_Duntsch_JACKSON.jpg><p>Dawson’s Creek heartthrob Jackson stars as the titular character of <a href=#>Dr Death</a>, which ended up becoming <a href=#>Duntsch</a>’s nickname after the accusations came out.</p><p>The 43-year-old new dad, who welcomed his first child with wife Jodie Turner-Smith last year, brought his WB experience to portray the “charming” aspect of the surgeon, as the other characters often call him on the show.</p><p>That only lasted for a short while, as he dove deep into the role to bring out the “evil” of the real-life character in the eight-episode series, he told <a href=#>New York Post</a>.</p><p>In February 2017, <a href=#>Duntsch, 50, was convicted of a first-degree felony</a> for intentionally injuring an elderly victim.</p><h2>Dr. Robert Henderson / Alec Baldwin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/ES_Henderson_BALDWIN.jpg><p>The 30 Rock alum also heads up the <a href=#>cast</a> of the Peacock series as a doctor, though he plays one of the surgeons working to take Duntsch down.</p><p>Baldwin, 63, plays a more mature character to his onscreen partner Christian Slater’s zany one, with the two pairing up in quest to end Dr Death’s medical career and bring him to justice.</p><p>In real life, after helping the ADA Michelle Shughart send Duntsch to jail, Dr Henderson continues to practice medicine in Texas.</p><h2>Dr. Randall Kirby / Christian Slater</h2><img

Slater takes on a more brash and quirky doctor role as Dr Kirby, though both work side by side to help reveal the truth about Duntsch's botched surgeries.</p><p>The 51-year-old recently starred in the USA true crime series, Dirty John, opposite Connie Britton.</p><p>Slater is also known for his roles in Mr. Robot, True Romance, Very Bad Things, and Robot Chicken.</p><p>Like Dr Henderson, Dr Kirby is still a practicing doctor in real life.</p><h2>Michelle Shughart / AnnaSophia Robb</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/ES_Shughart_Robb.jpg><p>AnnaSophia Robb, 27, portrays Michelle Shughart, the assistant district attorney on Dr. Death's case.</p><p>She worked with Dr Henderson and Dr Kirby to bring Duntsch to justice, talking to everyone from his life, both from after he became a doctor and from when he was still training to be one.</p><p>Robb is known for her roles as Bethany Hamilton in Soul Surfer, Lacey in The Act, and Violet Beauregarde in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</p><h2>Jerry Summers / Dominic Burgess</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/ES_SUMMERS_BURGESS.jpg><p>Santa Clarita Diet's Dominic Burgess plays <a href=#>Jerry Summers</a>, a former patient and best friend of Dr Death's.</p><p>Summers died a few months ago, in February 2021, after getting an infection connected to the botched surgery from Duntsch that left him a quadriplegic.</p><p>An "In Memoriam" tribute for him is shown at the end of the final episode of the Peacock series.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>Wendy Young /
