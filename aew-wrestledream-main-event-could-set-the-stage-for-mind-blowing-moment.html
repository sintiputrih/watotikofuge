The Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, Washington will play host to quite an event, and a big surprise could be in store for fans.</p><p>Fans tuning into AEW WrestleDream on Sunday night can anticipate an exciting lineup. The main event for WrestleDream has not been confirmed yet. Tony Khan has hinted at a new era for AEW in the lead-up to the show, sparking curiosity about what this really means.</p><p>During the AEW <a href=#>Countdown to WrestleDream</a>, Darby Allin shared the significance of competing in the main event in his home city, but AEW has yet to confirm it. This certainly adds to the rumors that are going around about Edge potentially making his AEW debut at this event, as his WWE deal expires on Saturday, making it an exciting way to close the show.</p><p>“I’ve waited to be in the main event of a show for so long. My whole entire life, I never felt good enough. There was always a voice in the back of my head saying, You shouldn’t be here. You don’t deserve any of this. But like I said, the only time I felt validated was when I was TNT champion. Then you got a guy like Christian Cage. He’s got the one thing that made me feel like I meant in this whole entire world.”</p><p>“He later added, “”You haven’t seen. Until you wrestle Darby in Seattle at Russell. In the main event, you are fighting someone that.”</p><p>Dave Meltzer noted on <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a> that Edge could very well be a huge surprise at the end of WrestleDream, if Christian Cage vs Darby Allin is in the main event. It appears that is the plan by the way Allin is speaking about this match.</p><p>Edge’s WWE deal expires before WrestleDream, and there is no non-compete clause attached. <a href=#>He could show up at WrestleDream</a>, and be a huge closer to AEW’s night in Seattle.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News also previously exclusively reported that&nbsp;</a>there is an internal belief within WWE that Edge is going to AEW. A short time later,&nbsp;<a href=#>Sean Sapp reported that there is also belief</a>&nbsp;within AEW that Tony Khan will ink Adam Copeland to a contract.</p><p>AEW has a huge show for Seattle fans, with plenty of reasons for them to show up. Washington natives Bryan Danielson, Darby Allin, and Swerve Strickland all have featured matches on the Seattle show. Still, <a href=#>AEW had to change up their seating arrangement due to low ticket sales.</a> Hopefully, they get enough walk-ups to pack the house.</p><p>AEW WrestleDream should be a good show in Seattle for those fans, or anyone watching at home. Even if you’re not ordering the event,&nbsp;<a href=#>stay tuned with our results section</a>&nbsp;that includes AEW Dynamite, Rampage, Collision, and all the pay-per-views, so you can join the party live.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your take on AEW WrestleDream?
