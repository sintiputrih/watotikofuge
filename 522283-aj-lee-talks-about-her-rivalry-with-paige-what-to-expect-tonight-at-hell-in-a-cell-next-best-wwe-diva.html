Below are some highlights of the interview.</p><p>On her rivalry with Paige:</p><p>“Its very cool because everyone in the wrestling community knew who she was but she was a new talent and so for them to kind of jump on board that people didn’t know is a testament to how good she is and the chemistry we have. The last time I got to do something that lasted more than a month was with Kaitlyn and I think people are really interested in a story when you know, there’s a really good story to it and there’s chemistry and you kind of want to see new people be married for awhile. We’re going on four months now and kind of excited to see where it goes from here.”</p><p>On what to expect from tonight’s match following Night of Champions:</p><p>“Gosh, I don’t know. That’s the thing. Thank you for liking that and the mention. I’m so proud of that. We basically raise the bar and every time I’ve defended the title against Paige I’ve lost so I’m nervous. Its going to be interesting to see what we do that’s different and how we raise the bar this time and increase the intensity. We’re pretty unpredictable and prone to violence so we’ll see what happens.”</p><p>On&nbsp;the NXT Divas:</p><p>“I’m not the greatest at following it. What have I seen is when I’ve actually been there to have a match myself and I got to work with Bayley. As a person she is amazing and as a wrestler she is amazing. She knows who she is. She has an amazing character. I want the world for her. People I’d say to look out for her are Bayley, Lana, Summer, and Emma. Those are girls who I think has so much potential.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgZFraXFrXZa3brjEnmStmZygwG6twaisrWWYmr9uvsivmKWqqWLEqsDHZqeaoZeaeri0wK1kraddmsWxscKtZK2nnp60qcCMmqtmoJWhuW61zWaYZpuVobluusSxq2aalajBbsPWnmSdoaaW</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
