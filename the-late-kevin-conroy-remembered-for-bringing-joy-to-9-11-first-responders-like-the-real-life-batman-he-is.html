Though Conroy wanted to help in some capacity, he was told by the volunteer line that they didn’t need any more tunnellers or diggers. However, they did need people with restaurant experience to help feed first responders and other volunteers.</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cropped-image-131.png alt="Batman actor Kevin Conroy has passed away at age 66" width=185 height=308 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Batman actor Kevin Conroy has passed away at age 66 <a href=#>View all stories</a><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>“I’m an actor.

In I Know That Voice, a 2013 documentary about famous voice actors, Conroy recalled how people were in disbelief about the fact that he was the actor who brought the Dark Knight to life in Batman: The Animated Series.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>“We were getting all these hundreds of meals ready.

What’s your day job?’ And I says, ‘well I do voices mostly.'”</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>The other volunteer immediately exclaimed “I knew it! You’re the guy who does Batman! You’re that Kevin Conroy.” However, it wasn’t as easy to convince the entire dining hall of that fact. Conroy explained that when his architect friend announced to the sullen crowd that Batman was cooking their meal, people were in disbelief, with a person in the back shouting “make him prove it!” in response.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>“So I’m in the back kitchen, and I do from the back kitchen, ‘I am vengeance, I am the night, I am Batman!'”</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>After that, the crowd exploded with exclamations and laughter after a long silence, with Conroy’s architect friend later proclaiming him “to be Santa Clause.”</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>The clip where Conroy recounted this story was shared on social media following the actor’s death.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>“It’s one of my favorite stories he told about the power of his talents.
