Cimorelli, 27, and Gilbert, 39, tied the knot on October 3, 2020.</p><p>They seemed head over heels in love on their special day. But some fans still couldn’t help commenting on their concerns for Cimorelli after reading Williams’ painful account of her difficult relationship with Cimorelli’s new husband.</p><p>After Gilbert and Williams’ divorce, the latter said she wrestled with poor health, lost weight due to stress, and started binge drinking to deal with the pain. Eventually, she found her way to healing – not least because she said she’d always known the relationship would end badly.</p><p>while Williams has been more than forthcoming about her divorce from Gilbert, he hasn’t publicly commented on the end of their relationship. And while some fans might still be concerned about the future, it’s always possible that Gilbert and Cimorelli have finally found marital bliss with one another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHq4rdJmmqGZlGK0qrjBnqmtZaeewal5wZ6dqKqVYrWixcuesGavmaG5qq3MrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
