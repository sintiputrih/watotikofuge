He showed solid command and enough bat-missing traits in the lower minors, but in 2023 he got hit around more frequently in both Triple-A Gwinnett and in seven big league starts with the Braves. In seven big league starts, Dodd posted an 8.59 ERA, 7.76 FIP and allowed nine home runs.</p><p><strong>Scouting Report:</strong> Dodd is a pitchability lefthander with fringe-average pure stuff, but above-average strike throwing that has pushed him to the big leagues. He throws a fastball that sits in the 90-94 mph range and has been up to 96. He can locate the fastball to both sides of the plate nicely, but its fringy velocity and mediocre life means it gets hit hard. Likewise, Dodd has feel to land a gradual, low-80s slider and soft, low-80s changeup, but neither pitch has ever shown above-average bat-missing traits. Dodd added a mid-80s cutter to his arsenal in 2023 to provide a different look, and it could be effective to avoid barrels and keep the ball on the ground more frequently but its usage was minimal.</p><p><strong>The Future:</strong> Dodd has 40-man value as a depth starter or middle reliever, especially as a lefthanded pitcher, but heâ€™ll need to add something more--power, sharper secondaries--to establish himself as a regular on a contending team.</p><p><strong>Scouting Grades</strong> Fastball: 45 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 45 | Cutter: 45 | Control: 55</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufonyxuMCynKurX22Cd4CMnbClmZ5isbCww2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
