From <a href=#><strong>Ashley Tisdale</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>George Clooney</strong></a>, these celebrity best friends have stuck by each other side’s through thick and thin.</p><p>Tisdale and Hudgens <a href=#>formed a lasting bond</a> while working together on several projects. The&nbsp;Suite Life of Zack and Cody&nbsp;alum played Sharpay Evans to the&nbsp;Spring Breakers&nbsp;star’s Gabriella Montez in 2006’s&nbsp;High School Musical, 2007’s&nbsp;High School Musical 2&nbsp;and 2008’s&nbsp;High School Musical 3: Senior Year.</p><p>Their friendship continued long after the cameras stopped rolling, despite their onscreen alter-egos’ rivalry in the trilogy.</p><p>“We just have a connection and she’s so awesome and one of my best friends,” Tisdale exclusively told Us Weekly&nbsp;in August 2019. “What I love about her is that she’s so talented, and I think what we share is that we’re really grounded people and I think that that’s important, especially with what we do, is to stay grounded.”</p><p>The “Voices in My Head” singer pointed out that their relationship goes further back than their Disney Channel days. “We actually worked together a year before in a Sears commercial, and from that day on we were super close,” she explained. “So people don’t really know — I think some people know that, but they think it was that movie that brought us together and it really wasn’t.”</p><p>Hudgens later served as one of Tisdale’s bridesmaids when she and musician <a href=#><strong>Christopher French</strong></a> tied the knot in 2014. The BFFs expanded their circle after the Sharpay’s Fabulous Adventure star welcomed her daughter, Jupiter, in March 2021. Two months later, the Princess Switch actress <a href=#>met her pal’s little one and they had an instant connection</a>.</p><p>“Literally Jupiter opened her arms like hold me the minute she met Ness,” Tisdale wrote via Instagram at the time. “It warmed my heart.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Busy Philipps</strong></a>, for her part, revealed <a href=#>how she maintains her friendship</a> with <a href=#><strong>Michelle Williams</strong></a> years after the pals starred together on&nbsp;<a href=#>Dawson’s Creek</a>. “Whether you’re, like, in the public eye or not, I think the secret to longevity in friendships is putting in the time and the understanding and working through any issues that might arise,” the&nbsp;Cougar Town&nbsp;alum shared exclusively with&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in June 2019. “I think that especially now with texting, it’s even easier to stay in touch with people and be communicative.”</p><p>Scroll through to see which A-listers consider one another their BFFs!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJtkm56WqHpzfJBpaGtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
