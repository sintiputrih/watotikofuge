Could Alan be the blonde beauty’s knight in shining armor (or, more accurately, sequins)?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Alan Bersten from Dancing With the Stars have a girlfriend?</h2><p>The 25-year-old appears to be single at the moment, but he’s been linked to two DWTS contestants in the past. Alan was rumored to be dating UFC fighter Paige VanZant after he filled in for an injured Mark Ballas during Season 22 of the competition.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>When asked about their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purported relationship</a>, Paige coyly responded, "Who knows! A girl does not kiss and tell!"</p><p>Five seasons later, Alan was partnered with model and social media personality Alexis Ren. The duo’s undeniable chemistry helped them secure fourth place.</p><p>In an October 2018 interview, the influencer admitted, "I am developing feelings for Alan… And I didn’t see this one coming. But it happened really quickly though, so I think I’m still trying to process it."</p><p>But any romance between the pair <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fizzled shortly after</a> filming ended. "I haven’t spoken to her in a while. I’m not gonna lie. I’m gonna be honest," Alan revealed in March.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>He also stated that he’d like to keep things professional on DWTS from now on. "No more showmances for me. I’m done!" the entertainer declared.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alan Bersten and Hannah Brown laughed off speculation that they&amp;#x2019;re an item.</h2><p>After their cha-cha-cha earned the couple a 20 out of 30, the second-highest score of the night, it became clear that Hannah and Alan are a force to be reckoned with this season — but the heat between them remains firmly on the dance floor.</p><p>When asked about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their obvious chemistry</a>, Hannah said, "Look, we're having a great time… I think everybody has had this [Bachelorette] journey with me, and it's been focused on finding a person that I'm going to spend my life with, but right now, that's not what I'm focused on."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Alan added, "I want her to fall in love with dancing! She’s forced to spend the next few months with me."</p><p>Despite claims that their partnership is strictly platonic, the twosome couldn’t help but gush over each other on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>"Guys!!!!! We did it!! [Hannah] you are incredible. I’m so excited to be dancing with you all season!! Let’s do this fam!!" Alan wrote shortly after the premiere. Hannah later remarked, "ALAN-BAMA HANNAH. Coming in hot. I’m so excited for this season with [Alan] — we’re a good time."</p><p>Get ready because the dating rumors have only just begun... and we have a feeling this pairing is gonna make it to the finale!</p><p>Dancing With the Stars airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmiuoydmKebmaO0bsPIrZ9mrJiaerTAwKuqZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
