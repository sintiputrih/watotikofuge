However, the supermodel took to Instagram to show off her graying locks and how she has embraced agingâ€” much to her son's approval but to the dismay of some of her fans.</p><p class=dh>On March 5, Brinkley used her many years of modeling experience when she shared a picture of herself radiant and smiling on the beach. As she posed for the camera, the well-known model debuted her graying locks and the caption, in part, read, "Grey sky! Gray hair!... I think I may want to wait till it's more like the silver whitecaps than the grey wave itself! The verdict is still out!"</p><p class=dh>While Brinkley revealed that her son was a fan of her new look, a few social media users took to her comments section to share that they were not.</p><p class=dh>"People look older with gray hair. If you can afford to and want to color it... then you should color it," one person <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpaNXsouL8->wrote</a>, and another <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpaNXsouL8->typed</a>, "Please don't go there! God made you to be the most beautiful blonde ever."</p><p class=dh>However, some of Brinkley's fans revealed that they were feeling the new look, as one person <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpaNXsouL8->shared</a>, "Go natural to encourage more women to embrace the beauty of aging gracefully. Nothing wrong with silver/ gray/ white hair."</p><p class=dh>Another fan of <a class="me a" href=#>the model</a> <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpaNXsouL8->wrote</a>, "The only reason people say that gray hair is aging is that we, as a society, have been conditioned to think this, specifically with women."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Christie Brinkley Turns 69 - And She Is Proud to Talk About It</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In February, Brinkley celebrated <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.prevention.com/health/a42787959/christie-brinkley-aging-69th-birthday-my-days-were-numbered-instagram-photo/>turning 69</a> with a throwback of some of her magazine covers and a touching caption about how she had <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a43127978/christie-brinkley-aging-69th-birthday-my-days-were-numbered-instagram-photo/>embraced aging.</a> She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CoKv5TLOv0a>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Those days of hiding our age are over!
