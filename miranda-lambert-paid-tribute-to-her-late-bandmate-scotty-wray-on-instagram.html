He was a member of The Wrays, an Oregon-based musical group he co-founded with his brother Collin Raye (aka Bubba Raye). While Scotty Wray’s actual age is unclear, he was thought to be in his mid to late 60s at the time of his death. With decades of expertise as a guitarist, he met Miranda Lambert in 2001 in Greenville, Texas, when she was just 17 years old. Wray was part of Lambert’s artistic journey for nearly 20 years until his death.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Miranda-Lambert-2.jpg alt="Miranda Lambert" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wray was born in the Arkansas town of De Queen.
