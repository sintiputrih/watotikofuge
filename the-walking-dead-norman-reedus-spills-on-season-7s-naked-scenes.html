As a matter of fact, it appears Daryl will <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">go rogue</a> at some point, which only has us all the more intrigued to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">watch The Walking Dead unfold</a>.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>But while appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Reedus recalled those scenes from season 7 in which Daryl was reduced to Negan’s naked prisoner.</p><p>It was real.
