Now on its ninth season, the show follows K-1 visa couples as they navigate language barriers, cultural differences, and the pressure to tie the knot on a ridiculously expedited timeframe. With such high stakes, it’s no wonder that even the most well-adjusted <strong><a href=#>90 Day Fiancé </a></strong>couples end up calling it quits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, the show has managed to spawn some rather resilient couples over its nine-season run, with a handful even going on to build rather impressive families. Regrettably, some of these <a href=#>longstanding couplings have proved so toxic</a> that their longevity has been rendered a point of concern rather than celebration. Here’s a run-down of some 90 Day Fiancé couples who shouldn't be together, but somehow still are.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has 90 Day Fiance Pulled Some Of Its Stars Out Of Poverty?</a></span></p><h2 id=angela-and-michael><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Angela And Michael</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/angela-and-michael.jpg><p>When fans first met Angela and Michael on season two of 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days, it quickly became apparent that the two had a rather turbulent relationship dynamic.
