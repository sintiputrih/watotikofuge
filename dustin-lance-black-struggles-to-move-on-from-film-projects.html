It’s hard.</p><p>“I don’t think I ever just move on. I think it’s gonna take time to put myself back together, but good. Isn’t that what we’re supposed to do? If it was easy, I’d probably make a lot more money and it wouldn’t take as long. This has not been an easy one. This has been challenging. I think it’s gonna take a little time to heal and I might not make something that comes out next year, but that’s okay. I don’t do that anyway. I take my time.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Dustin – who is married to superstar diver <a href=# class=exposure-link data-linktrack=LinkTracker,articleExposure,tom-daley>Tom Daley</a>, 28, and has four-year-old Robert-Ray with him – revealed that he is working on a movie musical, but insisted it will not be a romantic comedy.</p><p>He told Collider: ” I am currently writing a musical that I’ve had to put aside for a little bit. But it’s not a musical rom-com. Music might be healing. We’ll see. I have to feel like we’re breaking something open that needs to be broken, or else I’d rather just stay in bed. That’s just how I’m built. I think I get it from my mom. My mom was curious, and my mom didn’t take s***from anybody. “</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnaysrJmjeq2tzZycZpqclrCsedKtqa6fl6GytHnTqGSmp6aaerC6jJ%2BpqKVdm7atuYypqaiilZjBtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
