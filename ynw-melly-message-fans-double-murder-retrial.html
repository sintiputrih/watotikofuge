As such, they argued, they needed more time to prepare — and Judge Murphy agreed.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Unfortunately, however, this means that YNW Melly will have to remain behind bars until then — and his mother was devastated about the thought. “I’m sorry, kid [teary eyed emoji][broken heart emoji]” she wrote on her Instagram Stories in response.</p><p>The delay arrived just <a class=underline-link href=#>six days after the court granted the defense’s motion</a> to have the jury struck down thanks to a legal misstep by the state — a move that was met with strong consternation by the prosecution.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In a memorandum of law filed on November 8 and obtained by HipHopDX, Assistant State Attorney Alexandra Bucklew stated that she, on behalf of the state of Florida, objected to the dismissal of the jury during the voir dire process due to the defense’s claim of an improper line of questioning — a seemingly minor misstep that resulted in the entire jury being dismissed at the defense’s request, and a request which was agreed to by Judge John Murphy.</p><p>What’s more, Bucklew remarked that the state of Florida was afraid of being unduly prejudiced if, indeed, the defense continued to raise objections about the empaneled jurors.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/consequence-recalls-wild-ynw-melly-studio-session-that-spawned-overdose-collab-250x142.jpg alt="Consequence Recalls Wild YNW Melly Studio Session That Spawned ‘Overdose’ Collab" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Consequence Recalls Wild YNW Melly Studio Session That Spawned ‘Overdose’ Collab</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 14, 2023</p></a><p>“The State fears that every time the State objects and the objection is sustained, the Defense will move to start over because it ‘affects their credibility with the jurors,’” she wrote in part.</p><p>Last month, Melly, his co-defendant YNW Bortlen and a third person, Terrence Mathis,&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=#>were charged with directing the activities of a criminal gang</a>&nbsp;and unlawful use of a two-way communication device, as well as solicitation and conspiracy to commit tampering.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>These are in addition to the&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=#>original count of tampering with a witness in a capital felony</a> that Melly (real name Jamell Demons) and Bortlen (real name Cortlen Henry) were charged with last month, relating to the <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>2018 murders of YNW Juvy and YNW Sakchaser</a>.</p><p>YNW Melly is accused of conspiring with YNW Bortlen in October 2018 to kill their two friends, YNW Juvy (Christopher Thomas Jr.) and YNW Sakchaser (Anthony Williams), and stage their deaths as a drive-by shooting.</p><p>If YNW Melly is convicted, he could face the death penalty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miwp69dorKtuNhmpJ6ro5a0pnnFmqWsZZSkwqO4xGakrqqUmr9uvsStqaKZnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
