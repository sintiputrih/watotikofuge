During an appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">The Skinny Confidential Him & Her</a> podcast, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener noreferrer">Caitlyn Jenner</a> explained that her favorite kid — she's got six biological children and 10 step-kids, by the way — "depends on the day," but that she's got a special relationship with one in particular: Kylie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Kylie is just the exception to the rule," Caitlyn said. "I mean, she's just — all the stars came together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to say that while she's close to both Kylie and her sister Kendall, there's just something that connects her to her youngest: "I get along very well with the two of them, but Kylie and I just seem to be closer most of the time."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Earl Gibson III / Contributor</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Proximity may have something to do with it. Caitlyn explained that she and Kylie make an effort to have dinner together at least once a week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Kendall's off kind of doing her thing, and Kylie, like, I had dinner last night at Kylie's house," Caitlyn said. "We try to do that once a week, once every two weeks. I go over there and she always has these great meals — prepared, she doesn't do them. ... But they're so good! It's better than a restaurant."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also noted that she and Kendall actually share a lot of things in common, though the secrecy she mentions keeps them from being as close.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[We] just have a glass of wine and talk about stuff and this and that. And so from that standpoint, we're a lot closer," Caitlyn said of her dinners with Kylie. "Kendall's not that — she's always very kind of a little bit more secretive. We're still very close, but it's kind of harder to figure out, where Kylie's more of an open book."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sadly, Caitlyn didn't mention her older daughters, though fans that have managed to keep up with the Kardashians did see a few <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>very special moments</a> between the family members.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeTlra1uNinZKOdnqOys3nCpaasnaJiwbB5yrKjop0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
