The year Sage Jill Cusick was born. I am eternally grateful for the challenges, lessons, blessings, changes, experiences and perspective that 2020 brought to my life and I will never forget this year. … It makes me emotional looking back at our journey leading up to meeting our sweet Sage. Being a mother is the most rewarding blessing in my life and I cannot wait to keep growing our family in the years to come.”</span></p><p class=x_p3><span class=x_s1>While raising her daughter, the professional dancer has shown that she is not fazed by Instagram&nbsp;haters&nbsp;commenting on her parenting.</span></p><p class=x_p2><span class=x_s3>“</span><span class=x_s1>This is my thumbs up to everyone out there who actually thinks it’s OK to comment or criticize anyone else’s parenting,” the new mom wrote in January 2021. “Why? Why do we do this to others? Especially people we don’t know. I know I’m far from perfect. You don’t need to remind me of that but why don’t we use our energy instead of always looking for the negative and finding things to criticize?<a href=#> I’m very over it.</a> So if that’s what you want to do on Instagram, please unfollow me and leave my kind and loving followers alone.”</span></p><p class=x_p2><span class=x_s1>The season 25 winner has been leaning on Cusick, her “best friend,” while raising Sage in the public eye.</span></p><p class=x_p3><span class=x_s2>“</span><span class=x_s1>I am so grateful for our friendship these past couple months with a newborn,”&nbsp;Arnold captioned a beach selfie with her&nbsp;husband that same&nbsp;month.&nbsp;“It has helped us laugh off the tired cranky moments (from me) hahaha and have patience with each other while going through the (sometimes hard) firsts that come with being new parents. And it has brought us the most incredible joy being able to experience the special <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> of parenthood together.
