Here’s what we know about Johnson’s net worth when he died.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=681 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Before getting into just how much money Ellsworth Raymond “Bumpy” Johnson reportedly made in the New York underworld, let’s first clarify who Johnson was and what he did. A native of Charleston, South Carolina, Johnson was in and out of jail throughout his life, serving time for burglary, and was linked to several assaults and murders, among other crimes. When he reached New York, he made the lion’s share of money running numbers, pitting him against established mobsters like Dutch Schultz. At the height of his power, Johnson was something of a Robin Hood-style folk hero, known to curry favor with the Harlem community by supporting the down and out.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Born in 1905, Johnson died in 1968. Many are already familiar with his story from the 2019 EPIX series Godfather of Harlem about Johnson, starring <a href=#>Forest Whitaker</a> in the lead role, <a href=#>New York Post</a> reports. Meanwhile, Johnson’s exploits were covered in a number of other books, movies, and TV shows.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>Referring to Johnson, his goddaughter, Verna Johnson said (via the Post), “Everybody loved Uncle Bumpy — unless you did something to him. Then he went crazy on you. He could beat you up and beat you down. My mother said that he should have been a boxer.”</p><h2 id=h-johnson-died-with-at-least-50-million data-injectable=false>Johnson died with at least $50 million</h2><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=#>Tuko</a>, Bumpy Johnson died with at least $50 million. Meanwhile, Johnson’s net worth was <a href=#>as high as $100 million</a>, according to some estimates. His cause of death was congestive heart failure. He was 68. At the time of his death, Johnson was under indictment on drug charges, just one of many criminal investigations in his lifetime. Evidently, Johnson earned a cool $1 million a year on his criminal enterprises.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>Johnson was married and had two daughters, and reportedly Johnson’s wife, Mayme Hatcher, donated the money she inherited when her mobster husband died to the NAACP and the Harlem Boys Club. In today’s currency, Johnson’s <a href=#>$50 million legacy would total closer to $440,000,000</a>.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>Referring to Johnson, Epix “Godfather of Harlem,” co-creator Paul Eckstein told the New York Post, “He wasn’t Robin Hood. He lived off the poor, robbed from other gangsters and helped where he could.” That said, however, after Johnson died, “the idea of Harlem criminals thinking they have at least some responsibility to the community, well, it got lost,” Eckstein added.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1osCMsJisZZKqurHFjKOmoaajpLu0ec2eq2avn6fBqXnWoZynZZiaeqW1xJ1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
