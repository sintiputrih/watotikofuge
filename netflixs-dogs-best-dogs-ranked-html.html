This is, obviously, a subjective process. The following bundles of slobbering joy are the ones I deemed the best boys and girls, in order, as of this writing. Tomorrow, I could conceivably change my mind about who belongs in first place because, aww, all these pups are the best.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjoojfrpj000n3h63wsqn3k0s@published>18.

(The fifth episode, “Territorio del Zaguates,” contains the most dogs numbers-wise, but there’s really only one, Max, that we get to know well.) Hence, the dogs from those two episodes dominate this list, starting with Santa, the pet owned by master groomer Kenichi of “Scissors Down.” We don’t spend a ton of time with Santa, but the fact that he has essentially the same hairstyle as Elaine Benes from early-’90s Seinfeld is reason enough to love him.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjooji5hj00133h631av3kcvf@published>17.

But she’s also spoiled rotten. Her clothes are nicer than mine. Her bed is probably comfier than mine. (It’s so posh!) She even has a larger stash of Champagne than I could ever afford. And you can tell she knows it, too. If she were a human, she’d be maddening, but to be that entitled as a dog? That’s a level of confidence that’s kind of amazing, and also worthy of one of those dumb talking-dog movies that you can easily find on Netflix.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjoojit68001d3h636lm5myvf@published>16.

Watch him during that fun little misunderstanding&nbsp;—&nbsp;he won’t even give that woman a glance.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjoojj75w001n3h63bbuh2ink@published>15.

If it’s possible for a dog’s fur to look like it’s having a bad, high-humidity hair day, that’s what Zeke looked like when his groomer, Cat Dotson, got started. But she turned him into a whole new dog, texturing his fur so that his two-toned coloring is runway-ready. He’s basically the Eliza Doolittle of Dogs.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjoojuh46001x3h63e3fgpj5d@published>14.

It’s a shame he didn’t compete with Princess instead: His artistry transforms her ears and head into a continuous fro of awesomeness that moves as one unit when her mom calls her name. If you saw that ear trick and didn’t say, “Awww,” either out loud or in your own head, you are the Ebenezer Scrooge of Dogs viewers.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjoojuz6400273h63shycnlv1@published>13.

Look at that beautifully sculpted, absolutely darling face. How could she not place?&nbsp;The main judge notes how cute she is and seems like she’s leaning toward giving her a prize, but then another judge talks her out of rewarding Eva because, and I quote, she doesn’t like “her rear.” This isn’t an ass-judging competition, lady. It’s a grooming contest and a cute-off and Eva is a winner, dammit!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjoojvt34002h3h63a3lpy6oe@published>12.

And by someone, I mean a friend or co-worker. But New York really can be friendly, especially to dogs and dog owners. Ichi, the little head-turner owned by Hearts & Bones dog fosterer Kyla, is a classic New York dog, the kind who helps her owner make 20 new friends every time she takes her for a walk. Also, take note of her ears: They are absolutely perfect little triangles!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjoojycff00313h634208d6wl@published>10.

I’ll keep wearing these dumb outfits.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjook010j003b3h63q1h1uwz4@published>9.

You’ll be all right.” Rider’s only crime is that he just wants to get the hell out of this grooming expo and go home with his mom. He’s basically a walking episode of Toddlers & Tiaras. Plus, the fact that he’s been dubbed “kind of a weirdo” immediately puts him in the top ten.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjook0xfp003l3h63k7skxk87@published>8.

By the time he makes it to New York, where he’s adopted by Neal, Emily, and their very happy daughter, Julia, he’s a whole new dog. I love that Jimmy overcame a tragic past, was temporarily named after an artist whose music is associated with drunken revelry, and ultimately became part of a stable home.

As Miki the groomer explains in this episode, that’s all it took for her: She spontaneously bought her pup D.J. and their relationship immediately convinced her to become a groomer. I love that D.J. is so inspiring. I also love that his own personal life goals are as follows: 1. Snuggle on Miki’s lap. 2. Continue snuggling on Miki’s lap until death. 3. Go to Doggy Heaven, which will consist of nothing but an afterlife version of Miki’s lap.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjook5ehk00453h63x9h91q3u@published>6.

But pair him with his new best friend —&nbsp;a sweet little girl named Meghan with a condition called VACTERL, which makes it difficult for her to maintain balance — and he grows at least six times cuter that day. With a harness that comes with a handle for Meghan to hold on to, Stax not only keeps her steady, but it’s obvious right away that he makes her very happy. I mean, look at them. They are so precious I can’t even deal.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjook7j8d004f3h630vl58ita@published>5.

He’s also a stray with such a fierce loyalty streak&nbsp;that he turns Jonny, the head farmhand at Territorio de Zaguates, from dog ambivalent into dog lover. Max is such a solid exemplar of the canine species that he even attacks a tapir to protect his fellow dogs. Know what I would do if I saw a tapir in person? First, I’d Google it because I’d have no idea what it was — note: <a href=#>it’s this</a> and I have no interest in ever meeting one —&nbsp;and then I’d run like the heels of my shoes were on fire.

As you watch the episode focused on him, you get the sense that he’s like the dog version of The Matrix’s Neo: He’s a Chosen One. He was put on Earth to play with Syrian children; sing for his owner, Ayham, over Skype; and eventually escape to become Ayham’s companion once again.

It’s amazing to see how quickly Rory goes into savior mode and&nbsp;barks when Corinne merely pretends to have a seizure.

He has resting steadfast face, so there’s never a moment in this episode when he doesn’t look noble, like a dog who is taking his dog responsibilities very seriously.
