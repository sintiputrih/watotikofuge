Here's why 'The Good Doctor' star can boast of being</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>On ABC's medical drama, Freddie Highmore, former August Rush turned Norman Bates, surprisingly channels 'The Good Doctor' and has been at it for four strong seasons. As the young, gifted, autistic titular surgical resident Shaun Murphy, at San Jose's St. Bonaventure Hospital, Highmore's early debut in the industry when he was all seven years old still remains one of the most fascinating things about the actor who has only grown since. But his talents go beyond just the screen because as the most common 'interesting facts' about the actor will tell you on the Internet, he can speak more than just two languages. Apart from the common English and French, Highmore has also earned a double first in Spanish and Arabic from Emmanuel College, Cambridge.</p><p>Highmore, a former child star, made his debut in 1999, in the comedy movie 'Women Talking Dirty'. He then went on to star in some of the industry's finest productions and cult classics so far. Films like 'Finding Neverland' (2004), 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' (2005), 'August Rush' (2007), and 'The Spiderwick Chronicles' (2008) all garnered massive popularity making Highmore a well-known personality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/27a29c4a-b7c8-4288-847e-6b3e41c84ebb.jpg><p>With two Critics' Choice Movie Awards for Best Young Performer, Highmore garnered critical acclaim for his portrayal of infamous Norman Bates in the drama-thriller series 'Bates Motel' that ran from 2013 to 2017. And the year Bates wrapped, his journey as Shaun began. Soon he was nominated for a Golden Globe for the show that he was not only starring in but also producing.&nbsp;</p><p>But before all of that, in 2014, Highmore earned credentials to attest for academic excellence too as he picked up a double first from Cambridge University. With top grads in both Spanish and Arabic degrees, the then 22-year-old-actor had "successfully managed to balance his four-year studies at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, with a starring role as Norman Bates opposite Vera Farmiga in two seasons of the Bates Motel for A&E," his publicist had said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube is sprinkled with fan videos of Highmore speaking fluent Spanish and Arabic, also some claim he never followed up with the practice of speaking the latter. Highmore learned speaking French earlier in school as he revealed during a 2018 appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres show. At the same time, Highmore had also displayed his Arabic, teaching the host, Ellen DeGeneres how to say "I am from the USA" in Arabic.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if his expertise in four languages doesn't impress you, the actor is quite talented in the art of playing the nasal flute. Catch him as he returns on 'The Good Doctor's second half of Season 4, on January 11, at 10 pm only on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJiaeqi7zp1knaeTqbyzecCcq6iqXaeyrbHArJxmnJGpsm6y0Z6bnaGVYrWqs8empqudXaW8rcXGpaatZWRiuaK6xq6YoJ2jYq6zrcGimmaroJa7qr%2FHZp2rnZ6YtQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
