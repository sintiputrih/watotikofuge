In 1985, he landed his 4,192nd career hit, surpassing the previous <a href=#>MLB</a> mark held by Ty Cobb. Rose later retired with 4,256 total hits, still the most ever as of 2022, per <a href=#>Statista</a>. Clearly, Rose would have entered the Hall of Fame, however, he was involved in a scandal that may have forever jeopardized his chances. After retiring, he became the manager for his former team, the Cincinnati Reds. At the time, Rose was a well-known gambler and he allegedly bet on baseball games. A. Bartlett Giamatti, the MLB commissioner at the time, launched an investigation into the matter. Rose initially denied the allegations, though he accepted Giamatti's settlement, which included a lifetime ban from the MLB. More than preventing Rose from having a job with the league, the ban also meant he could never be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Years later, he confessed to betting, but explained it was only ever for his own Reds team to win, <a href=#>History</a> recapped.</p><p>Though Rose was officially left out of the league, he at least stayed close to the game as a postseason reporter for Fox Sports. Unfortunately, Rose couldn't even keep this job. After reports surfaced that he was involved in a sexual relationship with an underage girl back in the '70s, Fox Sports fired the former player, per <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWpjZX12e9Kppquso2LAta3RrGSwoJ9itLDAjKyrq5mZnLW1edSpZJ%2BhopqxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
