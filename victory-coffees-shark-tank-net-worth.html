And we are also an award-winning roaster.”</p><p>Read on for a recap of Victory Coffees' Shark Tank presentation — plus, an update on how the company is doing today.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">The ‘Shark Tank’ sharks passed on Victory Coffees.</h2><span id=the-shark-tank-sharks-passed-on-victory-coffees class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Shark Tank stars <a href=#>Mark Cuban</a>, Daymond John, Kevin O’Leary, <a href=#>Lori Greiner</a>, and <a href=#>Robert Herjavec</a> passed on the opportunity to invest in Victory Coffees when Courtley appeared on the show in 2017. (On YouTube<u></u>, the company called it “the biggest mistake the sharks made” that year.)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Still, Cuban was impressed by Courtley’s “heart” and “determination” during the pitch. Courtley said that he wanted to create what he called a Victory Army. “What I’m going to do is I’m gonna recruit, train, equip, and deploy an all-veteran sales force, and this is how we’re going to scale” he explained.</p><p>“Do not underestimate the power of patriotism,” Courtley said during his appearance on the show. “I will survive in the coffee industry the same way I survived in Iraq and Afghanistan. I’ll be better, quicker, and stronger, and I’ll crush the competition.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Courtley, who also wrote the book SEAL Survival Guide: A Navy SEAL’s Secrets to Surviving Any Disaster, later shared with the Denver Business Journal, that he wanted to sell franchises exclusively to fellow veterans. “I would love nothing better than to see a guy I used to work with in Afghanistan roll in with his wheelchair and be able to open his own business. If I am able to create a business model where they are able to come back from being deployed and start a successful profit-earning business, that’s what I want.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-jXcwIi jyCgFD"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Victory Coffees is still in business.</h2><span id=victory-coffees-is-still-in-business class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><p>On its website, Victory Coffees touts that it offers monthly deliveries of “award-winning coffee” in whole bean, ground, or K-cup form. “We pride ourselves on being a veteran owned and operated squadron that stands behind our quality and customer service,” the company adds. “Trust us when we say a good cup of coffee was often the best part of our day.”</p><p>Shortly after appearing on 'Shark Tank,' Victory Coffees was estimated to be worth $1 million.

Another reviewer wrote, “If they just once answered my numerous phone calls and emails, they may have salvaged a customer.” “Instead, they responded with something a teenager might say. Appalling.”</p><p>On CrateJoy, the most recent review reads, “I love the Admiral Espresso!
