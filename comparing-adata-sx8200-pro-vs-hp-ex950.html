It's based largely on applications that aren't highly dependent on storage performance, so this is a test more of application launch times and file load times. This test can be seen as the sum of all the little delays in daily usage, but with the idle times trimmed to 25ms it takes less than half an hour to run. Details of the Light test can be found <a href=#>here</a>. As with the ATSB Heavy test, this test is run with the drive both freshly erased and empty, and after filling the drive with sequential writes.</p><p><img alt="ATSB - Light (Data Rate)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13759/light-bw.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When the Light test is run on an empty drive, the SM2262EN SSDs offer excellent performance, but it's not meaningfully better than what last year's models did with the original SM2262 controller. What's changed is that full-drive performance is much worse, and the gap between empty and full drive performance is much larger for the Light test than for the Heavy test.</p><p><img alt="ATSB - Light (Average Latency)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13759/light-latency.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="ATSB - Light (99th Percentile Latency)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13759/light-99-latency.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The average and 99th percentile latency scores for the SM2262EN drives are barely slower than the Samsung 970 EVO Plus when the Light test is run on an empty drive, but the full-drive average latency is about as bad as a mainstream SATA drive, and the 99th percentile latencies are worse.</p><p><img alt="ATSB - Light (Average Read Latency)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13759/light-read-latency.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="ATSB - Light (Average Write Latency)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13759/light-write-latency.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The average read and write latency scores for the SM2262EN drives are within a few microseconds of the fastest drives when the Light test is run on an empty drive, but when the drives are full the read latency ends up in SATA territory and the write latency comes close to that.</p><p><img alt="ATSB - Light (99th Percentile Read Latency)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13759/light-99-read-latency.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="ATSB - Light (99th Percentile Write Latency)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13759/light-99-write-latency.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The 99th percentile read and write latency scores again show no problem for the SM2262EN drives when the Light test is run on an empty drive, but the full-drive performance is a problem. In this case, the 99th percentile read latency is especially bad, with the retail SM2262EN drives scoring worse than the engineering sample and providing tail latencies several times higher than the Crucial MX500 SATA drive.</p><p><img alt="ATSB - Light (Power)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13759/light-power.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The SM2262EN drives again show significantly higher energy requirements when the test is run on a full drive rather than an empty drive. The ADATA SXP SX8200 Pro's efficiency advantage over the HP EX950 means the former's efficiency is still decent by NVMe standards even for the full-drive test run.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50g5RyZpynnaWus7XNoGSanJGprm6%2F13FpaWhdpb%2BwedWsZKGoXZrFeoGPaGw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
