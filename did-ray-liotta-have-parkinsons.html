He’s also working on two projects that will be released later this year: Elizabeth Banks’ Cocaine Bear and an untitled feature directed by Charlie Day of It’s Always Sunny.</p><p>During this terrible time, our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Liotta’s friends, family, and loved ones.</p><h2>What did Henry Hill think about Ray Liotta’s performance in the Goodfellas movie?</h2><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">Shortly after the movie “Goodfellas” premiered in 1990, Ray Liotta got a call out of the blue from the real life Mafioso Henry Hill.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">The person Ray Liotta played so brilliantly in the film.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">———“Hey, this is Henry Hill. I’d love to sit down and talk with ya.”——</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">Actor Liotta had never met nor previously spoken with the brains behind the 1978 JFK Lufthansa heist.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">He was thrilled to talk to the gangster, then, in the U.S. government’s Witness Protection Program.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">The 1st thing Henry Hill said was———— “Thanks for not making me look a scumbag!”——</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">Ray Liotta said:</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">——-“Are you serious? Did you see the movie? You cheated on your wife, you were dealing drugs when your crew told you not to”.——</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">Hill hung up the phone.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">Lisa Caserta, Henry Hill’s fiancé at the time of his death in 2012 gave Liotta some of Henry’s personal items: a favorite hat and paintings Hill had done.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">Ray Liotta always sends Lisa Caserta a message on Hill’s birthday.</p><h2>Why is Robert De Niro projected as the actor in the movie “Goodfellas” rather than Ray Liotta who seems to be the central character of the plot?</h2><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">… it showcases Robert De Niro in the middle, with his name higher than Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta. This is a contract maneuver, which is very common. De Niro was obviously the bigger name. He was the top billed actor. It’s obvious that his contract for the film dictated that he get top billing. So in that context, you can see why he was billed as the lead.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">Beyond that, I agree 100% as far as the fact that Ray Liotta IS the lead character in the film. And it’s a damn shame the Academy didn’t recognize him with an Oscar nomination. He wasn’t nominated for any notable awards at all. It shocks me. To me, it was perhaps one of the biggest Oscar snubs of all time.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">As to why De Niro was nominated for a BAFTA as Lead Actor? The studio generally decides how they want to campaign their various actors for Awards season. If you read Variety, you’ll often see the For Your Consideration ads which basically announce how the studio would like voters to vote for each actor. They likely chose Best Actor for De Niro because of his top billing and perhaps because he is so connected as leads for Martin Scorsese films.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start">But I agree. Liotta was vastly underappreciated in the role. Without his performance, there is no film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnaCdZaKWxm64yKirrZldna63sYypmKujmaPAsLrSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
