The pair hit it off soon after meeting, though Ashlee can’t seem to move past Kirston behaving like men she’s dated.</p><p>As Ashlee explained in a clip from Season 1, Ep. 9, “Don’t Call It a Comeback,” she isn’t “new to this rodeo” and has been dating for a long time.</p><p>So, even though Kirston showers her with compliments and a lavish dinner, Ashlee isn’t sure Kirston is her match because of his familiar behavior.</p><p>“I’m not going to lie, I’m very attracted to you, but I’m scared,” Ashlee admits to Kirston in the clip. “Because you remind me so much of all the guys I’ve dated before.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kirston isn’t feeling Ashlee’s blanket comparisons of him and her previous boyfriends. He assures her that he doesn’t need much from her but to continue having a good time together on their dates, which he said Ashlee provides. And like Ashlee, Kirston said he’s looking for something serious and is ready to settle down and “give fate a shot.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Ashlee is still a little guarded, she opens up and gives Kirston a big smile on their date and asks why it “took so long” for her to meet her potential boo. And, despite her “repeat offender history,” Ashlee is willing to give Kirston a shot and tells him she wants to try texting and hanging out with him more.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kirston isn’t worried about his ‘Ready To Love: Make A Move’ competition.</h2><p>Ashlee’s reservations about being vulnerable are valid. After a public breakup with former Ready to Love contestant <a href=#>Alexx Blanks</a>, she’s guarding her heart this time, which Kirston understands.</p><p>During their date, Kirston assured Ashlee he was committed to giving her as much time and space as needed. He also said he’s not concerned about Ashlee being “booked and busy” with other dates because he knows he’s the best choice at the end of the day.</p><p>“Peripheral opponents are what Pat Reilly calls it,” Kirston says on Ready To Love: Make A Move. “I won’t compete; I’ll just continue to be myself, continue to put my best foot forward, and do what I’m supposed to do as a man to show her that I want to be in her life.”</p><p>See what happens between Ashlee and Kirston on Ready To Love: Make A Move.
