News reached out to the Knocked Up star, her reaction to her character getting eyes for a bad guy was “I think she is like so fascinated by him, cause he is so sweet but also so bad. She is drawn to him.” Maude said this laughing and agreeing to the reporter that the same thing would be likely impossible for her in real life. Because, when it comes to dating in real life she cannot get anything past her mamma Leslie Mann.</p><p>As you know, Maude is the daughter of celebrated comedy director/producer Judd Apatow and actress Leslie Mann.
