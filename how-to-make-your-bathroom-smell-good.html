"Obviously, you also want your bathroom to smell inviting for other people, too—like guests."</p><p>According to experts, candles and air fresheners aren't the only ways to upgrade the aroma in this space. Keep reading for their simple yet unique alternatives that can help make your bathroom smell better than ever.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>6 Scents That Will Help You Relax, According to Aromatherapy Experts</a>.</strong></p><h2>How to Make Your Bathroom Smell Good</h2><h3>1. Hang eucalyptus or lavender in the shower</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/shutterstock_1929063368.jpg><p><strong>Artem Kropovinsky</strong>, an interior design expert and founder of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Arsight</a>, recommends hanging a bunch of fresh eucalyptus from your showerhead with twine.</p><p>"The shower steam will release its soothing scent, transforming your bathroom into a tranquil space," he explains.</p><p>Eucalyptus leaves contain powerful <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>essential oils</a> that evaporate when they interact with the steam in the air, creating the same effect as a diffuser. The best part? The eucalyptus will stay fresh in your shower for two to four weeks.</p><p>If you don't enjoy the scent of eucalyptus, <strong>Chantelle Hartman Malarkey</strong>, interior designer and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>hosting expert</a>, recommends <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>hanging lavender</a>.</p><p>It's an excellent alternative for creating a spa-like atmosphere, especially given that a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>2022 study</a> found the scent of lavender can reduce stress and promote calm.</p><h3>2. Create DIY perfume-bottle diffusers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/shutterstock_1825804409.jpg><p>Don't throw away those old, empty perfume bottles. According to Kropovinsky, you can repurpose them into a DIY diffuser by filling them with a mix of baby oil and essential oils.</p><p>Use a funnel to pour your preferred oils into the bottle, and then add some diffuser sticks to soak up and spread the fragrance. Place the diffuser on your bathroom counter, a shelf, or even on the back of your toilet.</p><p><strong>For more home advice delivered straight to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><h3>3. Make soap sachets</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/Bar-Soap.jpg><p>Have any bars of soap on hand that smell spectacular? You can actually use them to improve the scent in your bathroom, according to Kropovinsky.</p><p>Wrap the bars of soap in mesh or tulle. Then, wrap some twine or ribbon around them and hang them from your shower curtain rod. "They will slowly disperse their scent, acting like ornamental fresheners," he explains.</p><h3>4. Put together homemade potpourri</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/shutterstock_1916137225.jpg><p>Potpourri—a mixture of dried spices, flower petals, and herbs placed in a sack or bowl—can instantly give your bathroom a lovely scent. While you can buy pre-made mixes, Kropovinsky suggests making your own so you can customize it to your own preferences.</p><p>It's pretty simple: After air drying the materials or using silica gel to dry them out, add six to 10 drops of your favorite essential oil, mix the contents gently, and then wait a month or so for the scents to blend and intensify.</p><p>Kropovinsky advises placing the blend in an open non-metal container—such as a glass jar or bowl. "It will double as an attractive piece of décor and a natural freshener."</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Why Does Your House Have Its Own Smell? Experts Explain "Occupant Odor"</a>.<br></strong><span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><h3>5. Keep coffee grounds out</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/coffee-filter.jpg><p>Have you ever noticed that perfume departments and fragrance shops often display dishes filled with coffee grounds? There's a good reason for this.</p><p>Coffee grounds essentially act as an olfactory "palate cleanser" for your nose. That's why Duckworth recommends keeping a small bowl of them in your bathroom. "They help absorb and neutralize unwanted smells," she explains.</p><h3>6. Use shower bombs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/shutterstock_2287486827.jpg><p>You've likely heard of bath bombs, but have you ever used their shower counterparts? Shower bombs are one of Malarkey's favorite ways to make a bathroom smell better because they have a much higher concentration of essential oils than bath bombs. When you take a shower, the steam releases those oils into the air.</p><p>All you have to do is drop the bomb on the shower floor, turn on the water, and wait for the steam to spread a delightful aroma throughout your bathroom.</p><h3>7. Make scented toilet paper rolls</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Woman-going-into-bathroom.jpg><p>Another fun DIY option, says Kropovinsky, is to make your toilet paper scented by adding a few drops of your preferred essential oil to the cardboard inside the roll. (Note: make sure not to drop the oil directly onto the toilet paper, as direct contact with your skin could cause irritation.)</p><p>"The spinning motion that happens when anyone dispenses the toilet paper will distribute the fragrance, keeping your bathroom air fresh," he explains.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmoaenYsGwecyaop5lqaTCs3nBmquhqp%2Bkum6%2FzJ6jpWWXpLylew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
