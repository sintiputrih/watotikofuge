In fact, based on exhaustive social media research, it is possible that she is always on vacation. Like other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>perpetually bikini-clad celebs</a> (trust us, we keep track of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>this data</a>), Lipa regularly fills our feeds with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>teeny tiny swimsuit pics</a>, but unlike <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Hailey Bieber</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Kylie Jenner</a>, she doesn't appear to be snapping said selfies poolside at her place. Instead, she reads, vamps, and lounges on various balconies and beaches around the world. It seems to us that the "Dance the Night" singer is, ostensibly, always on vacation, to the point that we need to figure out how she still accomplishes so much yet spends so much time globetrotting. Let’s investigate.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">May and June have been chock-full of Dua Lipa vacay fashion inspo, thanks in large part to how booked and busy this A-lister is. There was, of course, the Met Gala (which Lipa co-chaired) to attend, and several pristine beaches and gardens in which to read the latest titles picked by her Service95 newsletter's book club. Lipa also spent time in Italy for "La Vacanza," a dreamy womenswear collection she co-designed alongside Donatella Versace, before getting off to its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>official runway debut</a> in Cannes, France.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dua Lipa Instagram</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While launching — and modeling — a fashion line, Lipa also made time to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>twirl in gardens</a>, attend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Porsche races</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>book festivals</a>, and walk the Cannes Film Festival red carpet with a new man. Like many celebs, she snapped a lot of bathroom selfies along the way, and yet does not appear to have taken any of said selfies in the same bathroom mirror.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dua Lipa Instagram</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We think it's worth noting that, while Lipa might never strike a sultry yet disaffected pose in the same bathroom mirror twice, her vacations aren't just pleasure trips around the world. Sure, she knows exactly how to live it up away from home, but Lipa also seems to be making money moves on at least half of her trips around the world. Case in point? An Instagram photo dump from June 18 captioned "24 hours."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The eight photos in the post not only show the A-lister cheers-ing with friends over cocktails and oysters, but also include a screenshot from what looks like a set with Lipa holding hands with two other women. New music vid perhaps?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then there was the time back in March when the singer was "living on island time." She showed off a series of swimsuits on the grid, including a Hello Kitty bikini top, to commemorate the tropical trip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before that, according to Instagram, she was in Paris, Barcelona, and Paris again. And surely several luxurious destinations in between. But one thing's for sure: Wherever in the world Dua Lipa is, her big business vibes and big vacation energy is the kind of jet-setting life we can get behind.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w66YZqSZpa5uwsCcmK2hn6N6qrrSrZigqpGieqq60qmgq5mknryveZZua3BvYG4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
