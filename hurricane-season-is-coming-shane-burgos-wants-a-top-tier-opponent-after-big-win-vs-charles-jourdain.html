Sure, he stumbled a few times against top-tier competitors, but it’s clear he can hang with the big boys of the UFC’s Featherweight division.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>UFC on ABC 3’s main card started off right, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a> figured in a barn-burner against the equally entertaining Charles Jourdain. Both fighters vowed an exhilarating match and held true to their word.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>There was no such thing as a feeling-out process for the two, as they threw haymakers at each other at the opening bell. While both fighters got their shots in, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a> got the upper hand when he dragged Jourdain to the ground, took his back, and locked him in a tight body triangle.</p><p class=p1>This allowed the Fan Arch athlete to control the position and even sunk a rear-naked choke! But Jourdain is no slouch on the ground either and survived the submission attempt.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>He bounced back in round 2 and was actually getting the better of the exchanges up until <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a> caught him on the fence and once again took his back. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a> kept busy on the ground, punishing Jourdain with strikes and submission attempts.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>It was all or nothing for Jourdain in round 3, and he peppered <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a> with strikes on the feet. Despite obviously leading in the scorecards, we know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a> loves a good scrap and dished out some punishment of his own. What a fight it was!</p><p class=p1>But in the end, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgo</a>s was declared the winner, improving his record to 15-3 (8-3 in the UFC).</p><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Do you feel the Hurricane season coming?

Hurricane understands he still has a tall ladder to climb to reach the top but looks forward to the next challenge on his way.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a> made it clear he wants a ranked opponent in his next bout.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“There’s a lot, but I definitely want someone top 15. I think me and (Dan) Ige would be a fun fight. Me and the ‘Korean Zombie’ (Chan Sung Jung) would be a fun fight,” Burgos said in the post-fight conference.</p><p class=p1>“I don’t know who else off the top of my head, but those fights would be fun. You’ve got guys outside the top 15 that would be fun. But listen, I did that twice already. Guys, give me a ranked guy next, someone that’s going to move me forward.”</p><p class=p1>Who would you like to see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a> fight next?</p><p class=p1><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a>, along with 700+ professional athletes and influencers, has personalized merchandise on the Fan Arch’s website!</p><p class=p1>Fan Arch aims to transcend the narrative by making it easier to bridge the gap between athletes, influencers, and their fans.
