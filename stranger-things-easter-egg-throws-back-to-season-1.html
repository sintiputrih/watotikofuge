It was one of the most emotional ones of the first season and the first not directed by the show’s creators, <strong>Matt</strong> and <strong>Ross Duffer</strong>. The episode was instead directed by <strong>Shawn Levy</strong>.</p><p>The ending of the episode showed Eleven (<a href=#><strong>Millie Bobby Brown</strong></a>) lead the group to the water, where authorities were pulling a body out of the water. At that moment, all believe that Will (<strong>Noah Schnapp</strong>) is dead (well, except Eleven). The boys run away from her, after snapping. Mike (<strong>Finn Wolfhard</strong>) runs home and hugs his mom; Jonathan (<strong>Charlie Heaton</strong>) hugs Joyce (<a href=#><strong>Winona Ryder</strong></a>) in the street, as the sirens ring in the background.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stranger-things-easter-egg-02.jpg><p>“This may very well be the most emotional episode of the season, and a lot of that has to do with the ending. Shawn picked that <strong>Peter Gabriel</strong> cover of <a href=#><strong>David Bowie</strong></a>’s ‘Heroes’ and played it over some of our favorite shots from the show,” the Duffer brothers wrote in <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2016. “When Jonathan hugs Joyce, their bodies silhouetted by the car headlights, and the camera slowly cranes up to reveal distant sirens … it gives us goose bumps every time we watch it.”</p><p>However, the underlying message is that Will, of course, is not actually dead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stranger-things-easter-egg-01.jpg><p>In the season 3 finale, Eleven sobs after reading Hopper’s letter, and in the moments before the credits begin, the song begins: Peter Gabriel’s cover of “Heroes.” It’s safe to say that using the same song wasn’t a coincidence, but could it be a sign that Hopper is not actually dead like they all think.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>If that post-credits scene was any warning — Hopper has to be “the American,” right? — it was the perfect hint.</p><p>Stranger Things season 3 is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqtqpGjtKa%2BjK2foqaXqHqmrdKtnKtllZy0bsDHq6awq12XrqS3jK2mZquVlsCwuoxqZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
