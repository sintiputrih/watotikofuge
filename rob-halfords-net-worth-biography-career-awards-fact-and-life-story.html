Rob Halford has earned his net worth as the lead vocalist for the heavy metal band Judas Priest. Born in England in 1951, Rob Halford first met a member of the heavy metal band Judas Priest while his sister was dating co-founder Ian Hill.</p><p>He joined the band, which released its first single, “Rocka Rolla”, in 1974, and an album with the same title later in the year. In 1991, he attracted attention for riding a motorcycle onto the stage during a show, crashing it and breaking his nose. Thirteen albums and almost two decades after the band’s debut, Halford announced he would be leaving Judas Priest in 1992. Halford bounced around with several bands after leaving Judas Priest, making appearances on two albums with Fight and later with his own band Halford. He returned to Judas Priest more than a decade later, appearing on the 2005 album “Angel of Retribution” and the 2008 effort “Nostradamus”. Halford has been part of several vocal efforts with Black Sabbath, has filled in for Ozzy Osbourne and voices several characters in the video game “Brutal Legend”. He came out as gay in 1998 and lives in Phoenix, Arizona. Halford is a car enthusiast with several vintage cars, including a 1970s Aston Martin and a Mercury Cougar, in his collection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqfl3qprcufpquco2K7psCMsKarrJhir6q7xquYqaCpYrCivsSeqWaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMn5icrF2Wu6V5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
