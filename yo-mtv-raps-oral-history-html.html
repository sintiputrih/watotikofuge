Will Smith), and Ready Rock C on August 6, 1988, served as the official welcome to <a href=#>Yo! MTV Raps</a>, the network’s first show dedicated entirely to rap music. Part of a weekend of MTV programming devoted to hip-hop music videos, the episode was technically the pilot for what would quickly become one of MTV’s most popular original shows, spawning weekly installments hosted by hip-hop legend Fab 5 Freddy and, soon after, daily episodes presided over by the beloved New York comedic duo Ed Lover and Doctor Dré. But when that very first episode of Yo! MTV Raps debuted, it wasn’t<strong> </strong>really a pilot yet — it was more like an experiment.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyq5f00173g7a3dqifg25@published data-word-count=132>Rap music and hip-hop culture had been <a href=#>coming of age in New York for well over a decade</a> before Yo! MTV Raps arrived. Even though the music channel and arbiter of youth culture was headquartered in New York City, it was slow to incorporate rap into its programming. The first rap video to make its way into MTV’s rotation was Run-D.M.C.’s “Rock Box” in 1984, after the cable network had been on the air for three years. While certain artists, including Run-D.M.C., Beastie Boys, the Fat Boys, and DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, got some play from MTV in the years that followed, Yo! MTV Raps was what finally flung the doors to the genre wide open, expanding upon the mainstream success that hip-hop had already started to achieve elsewhere.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyq7g00183g7a1gpppwpg@published data-word-count=96>Ultimately, two white guys who worked in the promotions department at the network — Peter Dougherty, who was famous for being plugged in to emerging music scenes, and Ted Demme, a production assistant who would later become the director of films like The Ref, Life, and Blow — were responsible for creating Yo! MTV Raps. They’d envisioned it as the hip-hop version of 120 Minutes, MTV’s alternative-music show, and Headbanger’s Ball, its heavy-metal offering. (Ironically, they first had success with the concept at MTV Europe, where a pilot debuted in 1987, before American MTV got onboard.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyq8u00193g7ambol6i2t@published data-word-count=117>Sadly, neither of them is still with us; Demme died of a heart attack in 2002 at age 38, and Dougherty also had a fatal heart attack in 2015 at the age of 59. But others who knew and worked with them were available to revisit the days leading up to that<strong> </strong>summer<strong> </strong>1988 debut and the revolution it kicked off: Doug Herzog, the head of the then-new original-programming division at MTV; Judy McGrath, who oversaw the promotions department in the late ’80s before going on to be MTV’s CEO; Fab 5 Freddy, the pioneering hip-hop artist, filmmaker, and first host of Yo! MTV Raps; and DJ Jazzy Jeff, the hitmaker who appeared in that pilot/experimental episode.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckf5iztxg001b3h7ah6u04uyr@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Genesis: “Man, we got to get a show on the air”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyqae001a3g7az6nav8ja@published data-word-count=81><strong>Fab 5 Freddy:</strong> Peter [Dougherty] was this guy that I met through friends. He was a quiet but very studious and observant guy that was a voracious fan of all kinds of alternative music cultures.

The people that are actually implementing this are not overtly racist, but they’re following what they feel are these norms. Radio in America was primarily segregated. “Pop” meant white. R&B&nbsp;— they’d have other names that meant “Black” — and those stations were separated. You go to England and other places, and they didn’t have that type of distinct racial separation in the charts. It was a blend, and it was great.

MTV Raps that aired on August 6, 1988, is 49 minutes long, minus commercial breaks. There is no official host, but the introductions of videos and interstitial segments were shot backstage during the Run’s House tour, a national concert tour headlined by Run-D.M.C. and featuring artists like DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Public Enemy, EPMD, and the all-women trio J.J. Fad of “Supersonic” fame. Many of those performers appear in the episode, shouting out videos that were already being played on MTV, like “Parents Just Don’t Understand” and LL Cool J’s “Goin’ Back to Cali,” along with others that weren’t in the regular rotation: “Follow the Leader,” by Eric B. & Rakim, the first video shown in the episode; “My Philosophy,” by Boogie Down Productions, featuring KRS-One and directed by Fab 5 Freddy; and Biz Markie’s “Vapors.” Some segments have a “Hip-Hop 101” feel — at one point, Chuck D and Flava Flav set up a montage devoted to “up-and-coming” rap artists, which included the already-established acts Salt-N-Pepa, Kool Moe Dee, Biz Markie, Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock, 2 Live Crew, and MC Lyte.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyqvl001q3g7askil5u3k@published data-word-count=19><strong>McGrath:</strong> It was an experiment, and I think we did a lot of things quickly and on the fly.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyqx1001r3g7aiwd9gae3@published data-word-count=50><strong>DJ Jazzy Jeff: </strong>We just knew that we’re on this Run–D.M.C. tour for about four or five months.

I remember somebody on the crew asking did I think this had a chance to be on MTV? I knew MTV wasn’t playing anybody besides Michael Jackson and maybe Prince. I said, “Man, I’m sure MTV would not play this. I’m trying to make this video so it needs to be so Black, in terms of what KRS-One is doing and talking about, [that] I’m sure they wouldn’t want to play this video.

I’m like, “What is he talking about?” I never thought any of this was going to happen. I remember him telling me, “We played the video.” I was like, “What are you talking about, Peter?” “Yes. We played your video. Get somewhere and watch it.” I can’t remember where I went. I don’t know who I had to call that had cable.

The baseline of the network was probably a 2.0. For reference, today a cable series routinely earns a .2 or even a .06, so that Yo! pilot was a big win for us.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyr9f001y3g7ax7ipxkdc@published data-word-count=17><strong>Herzog: </strong>I could remember Lee Masters/Jarl Mohn being absolutely dumbfounded, like, “Wow!

I’m the guy that got the call when they made the attempt to begin to fix that ideology. Peter respected my creativity and my insights. He said, “Man, what would work good for you? What do you think would be a good way to do it?” I said, “I don’t want to be cooped up in that studio like those other VJs.” It felt more interesting and engaging to have you immersed in the world where the music’s coming from. Then what we would do to further that, once we got our feet under us, was, when an artist had a unique idea, we would try to shoot it in a way that reflected that. One time, we had a show with Das EFX, which was this cool group that had a real great style of rhyming, and they had this underground, straight-from-the-sewer vibe. We were like, “Yo, how do we capture that?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyrgp00243g7aysje7hy6@published data-word-count=48>We went in an underground railroad along the Upper West Side, where the Metro North runs, but it had this underground-railroad field.

Yo! MTV Raps also ceased to be the baby of two white dudes. In the book I Want My MTV, published in 2011, Dougherty says, “I was very insistent that we get black people to work on Yo!, and I was met with, “Why? You think that’s necessary?” And I was like, “Yeah. I don’t think it should be run indefinitely by a couple white people.” Producer Jac Benson and producer-director Moses Edinborough became integral parts of the team. Meanwhile, hip-hop continued to grow in popularity, to the point where a show devoted to the genre seemed redundant, since rap videos were then dominating MTV. Yo! ended its run in 1995.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyru800273g7a5cdz7k7z@published data-word-count=19><strong>Fab 5 Freddy:</strong> It was a half an hour in the beginning, and it went right to the moon.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckf5fyrxp00283g7arabv3r89@published data-word-count=98><strong>McGrath: </strong>Ted and Peter, once they opened the doors on this, all this talent and many of the musicians hung out in their offices all the time.

All of a sudden, Ted’s blasting music. There’s four people stuck in a cubicle together, and Freddy’s in there and Ed and Dré are in there and Darryl [McDaniels from Run-D.M.C.] comes by.
