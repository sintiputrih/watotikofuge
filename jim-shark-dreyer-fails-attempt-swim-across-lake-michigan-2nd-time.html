Dreyer, 60, had to call off his swim 30 miles out from Milwaukee when he encountered 8-foot waves, according to the television station.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The marathon swim was intended to mark the 25th anniversary of Dreyer’s first crossing of Lake Michigan, and he declared that he was going to swim 25 miles farther -- or 82.5 miles -- without an escort boat, the <a href=#>Holland Sentinel</a> reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">In 1998, Dreyer swam from Two Rivers, Wisconsin, to Ludington, Michigan. This year, Dreyer left Bradford Beach in Milwaukee for Grand Haven City Beach in his Michigan hometown, according to his <a href=#>website</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">His goal was shattered this year, but Dreyer was not discouraged after he had to give up. He was pulling a 10-foot dinghy from his waist and towing 225 pounds worth of supplies, the <a href=#>Sentinel</a> reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“It was a 25-hour beatdown, but I did not call for rescue. Dreyer wrote in a Saturday <a href=#>news release</a>. “Lake Michigan landed a flurry of punches, but I can take a punch and I was still in the fight.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">It was the second time this summer that Dreyer had attempted to swim the width of the Great Lake. He gave it a try on Aug. 1 but aborted the swim 10 miles east of Milwaukee when deteriorating conditions in the lake swept him and his escort boat more than 2 miles off course, <a href=#>WLNS</a> reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">According to the&nbsp;<a href=#>website </a>that tracked his progress, Dreyer stopped at about 6:30 p.m. CDT on Sept. 5, according to <a href=#>WTMJ-TV</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Dreyer learned how to swim when he was 32, overcoming a lifelong fear of open waters after nearly drowning as a child, according to <a href=#>his website</a>. Since then, Dreyer has managed to swim across all five of the Great Lakes.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“While I am very disappointed this swim ended as it did, I am more confident than ever that I can do this,” Dreyer said in his <a href=#>news release</a>. “I really wanted to get it done this year, but am out of time. I have other plans for 2024, but somehow, I believe I will find a way to juggle everything and get it done.”</p><p>Latest trending news:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKyimrultc2gZqOhnWLAqa3RpGSdqpWusrN5xZqgpatdlsG1scypq2arp566bq3Cq6asq12hrqyxjKagnKCZnK6veZGnm2asmaKycI6yg3qPinl%2BgnaTr4t9k4mFioSKpbWEgHCJXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
