At the time, the former couple released a joint statement announcing their separation.</p><p>“We have been blessed to share almost 3 decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage,” they shared. “Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.”</p><p>The statement continued: “Our family has been and always will be our highest priority. We undertake this next chapter with gratitude, love, and kindness. We greatly appreciate your understanding in respecting our privacy as our family navigates this transition in all of our lives.”</p><p>A source exclusively revealed later that month that the decision to divorce was <a href=#>a “gut-wrenching” one</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/deborra-lee-furness-opens-up-about-change-after-hugh-jackman-split-01.jpg><p>“Hugh and Deb just reached a point where they were more like best friends,” the source told Us, noting, “There was no drama or fighting — not that anyone is aware of, anyway.”</p><p>Jackman and Furness’ lives were “so interwoven” that figuring out how to split up their assets and finances was “extremely tricky,” per the source. “They’re determined to [do this] as amicably as possible.”</p><p>One month after <a href=#>announcing</a> their split, Jackman and Furness — who share kids Oscar, 23, and Ava, 18 — reunited in October 2023 to celebrate the X-Men star’s<a href=#> 55th birthday</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Thank you ALL for the birthday love!!! I’m reading your messages, seeing the special videos and experiencing all the feels 🥹,” Jackman <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned a photo</a> of himself enjoying a drink at the Polo Bar in New York City. One of the actor’s reps confirmed at the time that his estranged wife was in attendance.</p><p>Jackman met Furness in 1995 while filming Correlli, an Australian TV series, and the pair soon sparked a romance. They tied the knot the following year during a ceremony in Melbourne, Australia.</p><p>For their nuptials, Jackman wore a black jacket, a white shirt and a silky tie. Furness, meanwhile, stunned in an off-the-shoulder gown and layered pearl necklace. Her hair was twisted into a messy updo and she looked chic with soft glam.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZKkv7OtjKWcnmWWqr%2BvsdKsZKiolaPAbsHPZpibp6WpeqS0wKeenmWRm8GmvoyhrKCgXZ%2BupLfMmqVmq6ChtrV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
