Squid Game came out in September 2021, and quickly turned into Netflix’s most-watched program around the world, surpassing the record set by Bridgerton. I mean, if you even had the tiniest idea how mind-numbingly popular Bridgerton was, you know that’s an accomplishment in and of itself.</p><p data-characters=681 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Owing to its large subscription base, Netflix is the biggest streaming mogul in the world right now, and the company’s crowning achievement is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, this unnerving story about how people can be forced to gamble with their very lives to avoid the rock-bottom of poverty. And rather ironically, Squid Game‘s overwhelming success means that there’s no way Netflix is letting go of the franchise anytime soon. Not only has the industry juggernaut <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently released a spinoff reality show based on the show</a> — called Squid Game: The Challenge — but they’re actively working on bringing a second season to audiences all around the world.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>But what do we know about this second season, and more specifically, how many episodes can we expect to see this time around?</p><h2 id=h-is-there-a-squid-game-season-2-episode-number data-injectable=false>Is there a <strong>Squid Game season 2 episode number</strong>?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Squid-Game.jpg><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>Details have been far and few between regarding the second season of Squid Game. A sequel was greenlit in June 2022 — pretty late by industry standards, and due to the fact that Hwang wanted to produce a movie first — but by now, early production shenanigans must be well underway for the crew.</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>That’s why <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we know next to nothing about what season 2 will entail narrative-wise</a>, much less its episode count. If Netflix sticks to the format established in season 1, however, this next outing will feature 9 episodes. (Netflix’s own conventional format is 8 episodes for each season, but there have been exceptions here and there, including the most recent Stranger Things 4, which also consisted of 9 episodes, the release of which divided into two half-seasons).</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>Additionally, we can expect Squid Game season 2 to arrive sometime in mid to late 2024, this time with a new ensemble cast, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">featuring Korean icons like Im Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, and Park Sung-hoon</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8OoZLCdXaC7sMOMoaawZZ2Wu7p5xKmgrKeUmsBuw8ilo2aalWK2r3nSqqyinF2crq6xjKycmqufo3pzew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
