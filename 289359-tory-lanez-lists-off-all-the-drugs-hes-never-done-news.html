On Monday (June 15th), Tory shared a post on Instagram explaining that when it comes to drugs, he doesn't touch the stuff, unless it's of the cannabis variety.</p><p>"Fun Fact: The only drug I have ever done is weed. I never took a pill, not shrooms, coke, acid etc," he wrote on some photos of himself in his dressing room. In one of the shots, Tory is digging around in a labeled plastic bag full of bud, proving that he really is just a weed connoisseur and nothing else. He goes on to explain that, because he doesn't engage in these activities, his happiness is the result of a blessed life, not drugs. "I say this to say...that when u see me happy, it’s because I’m genuinely happy about my life, fans, and legacy I’m leaving behind for my family."</p><p><a href=# rel>Tory also recently explained his stance on&nbsp;weapons these days.</a>&nbsp;On his IG story, he noted that, "I've reached a place in life .. where it's like ... if I have to bring my gun to the function ... I don't need to be at the type of function anymore."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdibYZ0gZhmq6iqqWK5orrEs2SloaOpwG67xZ9kmqScYsGpsYydqa6fo2K1pr%2BMp5yvnaJisbC6xGalnq%2Bj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
