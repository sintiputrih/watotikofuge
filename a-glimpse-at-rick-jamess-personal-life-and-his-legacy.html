And, despite the fact that he died more than 15 years ago, his legacy is carried on by millions of people who love him all around the world, as well as his children.</p><h2>Rick James is the father of four children</h2><p>James has four children, two of whom he shares with former singer and composer Syville Morgan: Tyenza and Rick James Jr. From 1982 until 1984, after his divorce from Morgan, he dated actress Linda Blair.&nbsp;He reached out to her after reading an article in which she termed him attractive. Unfortunately, shortly after they began dating, she fell pregnant but had an abortion. It was a difficult choice for James, and he wrote about it in his book.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rick-James-3.jpg alt="Rick James" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Linda was someone I cared about, and it upset me that she would choose to kill our kid without even talking to me about it beforehand. I still regret her decision and ponder about our kid and how that child would have impacted my life. Tanya Hijazi, whom James met in 1989, eventually became his girlfriend. In 1993, they had their one and only child, son Tazman. The couple married in 1996 and divorced in 2002 after six years of marriage. The famed artist also has another kid called Trey Hardesty James, but his mother is unknown.</p><h2>Teena Marie Aided in the Raising of Rick James Jr.</h2><p>Though it‚Äôs unclear when James and Teena Marie dated, their relationship and numerous collaborations suggested they were close. They were engaged for two weeks, and their professional relationship continued until 2004 when she published her album La Doa, which includes a duet with James titled ‚ÄòI Got You.‚Äô&nbsp;Marie and James‚Äôs connection, on the other hand, was considerably deeper, and she even reared his son Rick James Jr. She told the narrative of how she ended herself caring for Rick Jr.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rick-James-2.jpg alt="Rick James" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rick was a strange cat that couldn‚Äôt locate his children. Cocaine is a powerful substance‚Ä¶ So his sister and I went in search of Ty and little‚Äô Rick‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt handle both of them!‚Äô Rick said as he stared at me and Penny. Listen, I can‚Äôt take both of them, T; you must choose one‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll take the lady. And I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the boy.‚Äù</p><h2>Tyenza Took Over Rick James‚Äô Estate After His Death</h2><p>Tyenza, the eldest of James‚Äô four children, is the estate president. She, like her father, dabbled with music, despite her father‚Äôs wishes for her to avoid it.&nbsp;Tyenza is the CEO of Stone City Brand in addition to managing her father‚Äôs wealth.&nbsp;Tyenza also has two kids, Charisma and Jasmine. Charisma is the older of the two and the mother of two children, Harmony and Zy‚Äôaire.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>‚ÄúWhen our angel girl, Ty, was born, I was over the moon.
