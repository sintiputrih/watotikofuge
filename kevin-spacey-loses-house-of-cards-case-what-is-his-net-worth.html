The actor will be forced to pay MRC $29.5 million in damages, along with $1.4 million in attorneys’ fees and costs. Spacey breached contractual obligations, including the producer’s anti-harassment policies, when he failed to perform his services “in a professional manner” that was “consistent with [MRC’s] reasonable directions, practices, and policies,” according to a Nov. 22 story from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>Spacey <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">breached those obligations</a> when he was accused of sexually preying on young men. More than 30 people have come forward to name Spacey as their abuser, including at least one person who worked on the set of House of Cards.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>Following Spacey’s removal from House of Cards and a general blacklist in Hollywood, MRC says it suffered from fallout. Spacey played the series’ main character, Frank Underwood, and was also a producer on the show. MRC’s fallout, following his removal, included the need for House of Cards’ final season to be delayed, shortened, and rewritten due to Spacey’s absence.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>The massive payout hits the 62-year-old actor after several years out of the spotlight, sparking questions about Spacey’s net worth. People want to know what the once-prominent actor is worth, and whether or not he’ll be able to afford the hefty sum.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Spacey’s net worth leaves plenty of room for the $31 million payout, but the court case will certainly take a large chunk out of the former star’s savings. Numerous roles over the years—his first major roles cropped up in the late ’80s—have earned Spacey a net worth of around $70 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>Even after removing the full $31 million, Spacey’s overall net worth still sits pretty at $49 million. Given the numerous allegations that have been levied against him over the years, however, it seems likely that Spacey will never work on a major film or television project again —&nbsp;unless there’s a significant redemption arc in his future. He may manage to find work in another field, but it will almost certainly sport a far lower paycheck than his years in Hollywood did.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>On Nov. 22, MRC filed papers with the Los Angeles Supreme Court seeking to “confirm the arbitration award.” Spacey’s attempt to appeal the arbitration was denied earlier this month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yssdWipWaroJawpsWMpaasnaNitbDB0p5kqJ5dmK6zsNJmmpqrlWLEqa3TZqCsZZiewG66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
