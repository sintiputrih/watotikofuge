The new <a class=hm-link href=#>Love Island</a> bombshell has joined the villa to (hopefully) turn some heads. But who is the newcomer? Here's everything you need to know about Scott here…</p><p id=e5g7JK003ej data-wc=48>Scott is a 22-year-old footballer who hails from Connah's Quay in North Wales. Speaking about his career, who plays the position of goalkeeper, he said: "Football is all I’ve ever done, all I’ve ever known. So this is a new and exciting opportunity for a change in life."</p><p id=eh9Lll-7FLC data-wc=40>Speaking about what he'd bring to the show, he continued: "Energy. I’ll bring a bit of banter, be cheeky, and I’m a flirt! very, very strong personality so if I see anything I don’t agree with, there’ll definitely be fireworks!"</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Who is your favourite Love Island contestant this year?</figure><p id=euXv7yMoNnn data-wc=18>He also joked that he was "tall, dark, handsome and I’m a goalkeeper, so… good with [his] hands". &nbsp;</p><p id=euhBqd6OMhX data-wc=61>So why is this bachelor still single? He said: "I’ve been single through my own choice," he explained. "As well as circumstances. I’ve moved around a lot with football and I’ve been based in Dublin playing football for over a year. I’ve been single for three and a half years so it’s been a while soI’m ready and open to anything!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6f7426ebd161-loveislandsr1048.jpg><p id=eQphfEtyCT_ data-wc=57>Scott admitted that he also hates it when people become "clingy" too quickly, saying: "I don’t like too many calls and too many texts. I’m not a fan of someone wearing Nike Air Force 1 trainers with a dress on a night out either or waking up with someone and seeing patchy fake tan in the morning." &nbsp;</p><p id=eRMgKjwfGj data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Love Island 2023 ages revealed: Who are the youngest and oldest islanders?</a></p><p id=eYWv39kn3t data-wc=9><strong>MORE:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Meet Love Island star Maya Jama's lookalike mum</a></p><p id=exXG7C1P-t3 data-wc=63>Scott will be joining the villa during plenty of drama. While Mitchel is determined to win over Molly – who is completely, utterly uninterested – Ella is upset that Tyrique is getting to know Leah, Catherine and Jess are set to clash with one another in Thursday night's episode, and<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Molly is keeping her eye on Zachariah</a> as he gets to know Charlotte.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/77dd243fe620-loveislandsr10ep904.jpg><p id=eYMLaTAUCIA data-wc=65>Taking to Twitter to discuss, one person wrote: "JESS VS CATHERINE?! THIS WASN’T PART OF THE PLAN?? WHERE DID THIS COME FROM," while another person added: " Nah all those takes about #LoveIsland being over and past it were soooooo premature. This feels like a renaissance of the golden years." A third person wrote: "Nah the producers snapped with this year's casting, I’m locked in."</p><h2>Who has left Love Island so far?</h2><p id=eZbZg2Cfawf3 data-wc=39>After George was the first islander to leave the show, Ruchee followed suit after finding herself single and vulnerable on the show. The other islanders chose to save Ella, and Ruchee opened up about her experience on the show.</p><p id=eQlIp6vIkAHU data-wc=65>She said: "I’m definitely rooting for Medhi and Whitney. Whitney really saw the vision from the start. She saw the potential and said, ‘I am going to show the world what I see.’ I’m so glad she made that choice. Obviously I was coupled up with Medhi in the beginning, I built such a good relationship with him. I love Medhi so much, he’s hilarious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4d23c0470880-loveislandseries10episode1210.jpg><p id=eKdSb7ytrprm data-wc=41>"I’m rooting for Tyrique and Ella as well. They’re so cute together. They’re like naughty school kids that like each other and flirt with each other. Andre and Catherine I think will do well, I feel like they’re each other’s type."&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
