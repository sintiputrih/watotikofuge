It marked her first appearance following her WWE release in September after a decade with the company.</p><p>During a recent appearance on <a href=#>Busted Open Radio</a>, Ash opened up about feeling that WWE officials didn’t have confidence in her, while some producers like TJ Wilson advocated for her. (H/t Andrew Thompson of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">POST Wrestling</a> for the transcription.)</p><p>“I honestly think they (WWE) didn’t believe in me. You know, producers, TJ (Wilson) was a very big advocate for me and he would always be like, ‘Dana can do it, Dana can do it, Dana can do it’ and it just — it wasn’t happening and I wasn’t that girl. I wasn’t the girl that they were trying to push to that next level. (I) was the one that I was always given to take the pin fall and I was okay with it, thinking in my mind, there’s gonna be a shot. There’s gonna be that next time and there just never was that next time.”</p><h2 id=h-money-in-the-bank>Money In The Bank</h2><p>“I fought so hard. I’ll never forget this and I think it was 2018 or ‘19 in the Money in the Bank match where I wanted to hang from the briefcase and swing from it and fall and a pile of girls catch me and they’re like, ‘No, no, no. That’s a little too dangerous.’ I’m like, ‘Do you not know I was in gymnastics for 18 years? And the bar was this high. I would do double backflips and layoffs out from underneath the bars. I promise you, I’m okay. Just let me do it’ and it would be a wow factor and I just don’t think that they had the confidence in me.”</p><p>Brooke was in the 2019 women’s Money in the Bank ladder match that was won by Bayley. She was a 15-time WWE 24/7 Champion and was last seen on NXT at the time of her release.</p><p><a href=#>Ash By Elegance (Dana Brooke): You’re Going To See A New Side Of Me In TNA</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsbmpwZmKutLSMm7BmnZyatKK6wp5knZmelnqjvs6oop5llKSytLrTZpmepJmaw6Z51rCcZqCRmXqku82foJ2dnpiybrXNZp%2Beql2ouKq4y6w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
