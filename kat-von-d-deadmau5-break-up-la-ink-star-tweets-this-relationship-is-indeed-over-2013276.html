On Wednesday, June 26, the L.A. Ink tattoo artist posted a couple of telling tweets suggesting that she had ended her engagement to her fiance because of infidelity.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Deadmau5 spoke out about the breakup on his <a href=#>Facebook</a> page. "Kat and I split in November and I moved back home to Toronto. During this time, while we were broken up, I did have relations with another woman," he wrote. "Following that, Kat and I reconciled and I acknowledged being intimate with another person while we were estranged."</p><p>"We did move past those issues, and I proposed to Kat in mid-December," he continued. "At the end of June, it was clear that the relationship was not working and we mutually ended the engagement. I was not, at any point, unfaithful to Kat during our time together."</p><p>Prior to Deadmau5's statement, Kat <a href=#>tweeted</a>: "Cheating on your loved one is the most hurtful thing one could do. I hate to have to admit that this relationship is indeed over…Onwards and upwards."</p><p>A short time later, a fan tweeted, "Don't take him back no matter what. Ur worth more than that." To which Kat replied simply, "Never."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Go Big or Go Home author, 31, first started dating Deadmau5 (real name: Joel Zimmerman) in September 2012. They broke up briefly in November but reunited shortly thereafter, and he proposed in December via Twitter. "I can't wait for Christmas so…Katherine Von Drachenberg, will you marry me?" the deejay tweeted, alongside a photo of what her engagement ring would look like.</p><p>Since then, the couple had been making plans for an underwater-themed wedding inspired by one of their favorite authors, H.P. Lovecraft. In an interview for The Wendy Williams Show in April, Kat gushed that her groom-to-be was "amazing," not just as a boyfriend but as an artist.</p><p>"We've been creating music together," she told Williams. "So I think I've met my match."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaRiw7C6jJ1knZ2RmbqiwZRmmaudkaB6tryMpZhmoZ6gerTAwKtkra%2BVmsG0edOhoKxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmleqq%2FjKKlnZ2VmXqwwsSrZGtoYWh%2FeIKO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
