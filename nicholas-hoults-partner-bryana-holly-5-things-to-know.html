One year later, news broke that the England native <a href=#>welcomed his first child with Holly</a>.</p><p>“The levels of tiredness are extreme. No one warns you about it! But the level of love that comes with it outweighs everything. It’s phenomenal,” Hoult told the <a href=#>Evening Standard</a> in January 2019, after becoming a parent in April 2018. “I’m loving it. And it evolves all the time. They change so much, every day is different. It fills you up as a human completely.”</p><p>It wasn’t until February 2020, however, that the “Zeds Dead: Collapse” music video star confirmed the arrival of the pair’s son. “Forever valentine,” Holly <a href=#>captioned an Instagram photo</a> with her little man at the fair.</p><p>That same year, the Crossing Swords alum gave fans a rare glimpse at his life as a father while appearing on the <a href=#>Late Late Show With James Corden</a>.</p><p>“I’m loving it,” Hoult said in May 2020. “It’s mad. It’s a learning curve, isn’t it? There’s a lot to take in. But overall, it’s like that time again, it brings back a lot of memories of your childhood.”</p><p>The Tolkien star continued: “It makes you play again — which I’m really enjoying, particularly with this time now with everything shut down and not having to work. I’m kind of just playing trains all day. It’s great.”</p><p>While Holly has since shared a few snaps of her little one on social media, she rarely opens up about her relationship with Hoult.</p><p>However, when the actor earned <a href=#>his first Emmy nomination</a> in July for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on <a href=#>The Great</a>, she gave her man a shout-out on Twitter. Holly reposted the Television Academy’s announcement of the category and added <a href=#>a series of exclamation points</a> on her own account.</p><p>Later that month, the influencer gave her followers a sneak peek at her home life, <a href=#>sharing a black and white snap of her and Hoult</a> hugging on Instagram. She also posted a scenic ocean shot and a picture of their son eating a beignet, captioning the bundle, “Lil love drop 🎨 🌹 📖 🍰 🌊.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ahead of their romance, Holly was linked to <a href=#><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></a>. Hoult, meanwhile, dated <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></a> on and off from <a href=#>2011 to 2014</a>. He then briefly romanced Glee’s <a href=#><strong>Dianna Agron</strong></a> in the spring of 2015.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about the Mad Max: Fury Road actor’s longtime partner:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNku6qvx6ijmqtdnby2uNOsZKmZoqm7pr6Mm6mymZ6Weqm7y6WwZm1dqbWqusasZK2nXaC7sMOO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
