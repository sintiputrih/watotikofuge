Calling the police, big tech or beefing up your security isn’t going to stop us getting to you, this isn’t a threat piers, it’s a promise. Your (sic) getting killed.”</p><p>A similarly disturbing message was then sent to Morgan’s sports journalist son Spencer, saying “If you don’t get your dad, your [sic] getting it or your mum.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Complete Timeline Of Meghan Markle And Piers Morgan’s Feud</a></span></p><h2 id=piers-revealed-that-he-was-particularly-rattled-by-the-troll-targeting-his-family>Piers Revealed That He Was Particularly Rattled By The Troll Targeting His Family</h2><p>Addressing the alleged arrest last night, Piers appeared relieved, attesting “<a href=#>People think it’s perfectly OK to make death threats to public figures on social media</a>, but it’s not — there has to be a line drawn, especially when family members are targeted.”</p><p>“That’s why I reported it and I am grateful to the Met Police and Greater Manchester Police for taking it so seriously.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A confidant of the presenter later added “This is a point of principle for Piers — he will not tolerate evil threats being sent to his loved ones.”</p><p>“A troll sent an unbelievably vile and graphic message to both Piers and Spencer, pledging to kill. An arrest has finally been made, but the lengthy investigation is still ongoing.”</p><p>“Piers hopes this evil troll ends up in prison where he belongs. Hopefully it’ll also act as a deterrent to other online abusers.”</p><p>As of the time of writing, it is thought that the culprit has been released on bail and that the decision on whether they are to be charged will be determined shortly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Nikki Minaj And Piers Morgan's Awkward Twitter Feud: A Rundown</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinop2iqHquu9GgmKdlpKe8rbiMmqmrnaOpsqV5wqGgpaSZo7RusMSaq6FlpJ2%2Fpq3TrGSsp55iwLGxzZycq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
