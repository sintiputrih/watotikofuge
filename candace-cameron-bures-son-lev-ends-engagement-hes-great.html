We will want to be a part of [their] lives, want to be a part of the grandkids’ lives. I don’t want to do anything to rock the boat.

We’ve been working on it for quite a while and I’m so happy that I get to share it with everyone,” she told Us on Thursday. “It’s really based off of what I love and my lifestyle, you know, I’m born and raised in LA. I’m a California girl. I love the West Coast. And so, it has a real casual, cozy, comfortable element to it.”</p><p>The former child star is also <a href=#>prepping for Mother’s Day</a>, revealing that she loves to receive personal presents from her family.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m a big sucker for cards, like, a huge sucker for cards. So, if my kids write me a card or even a letter and they write it through words, it is my favorite <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a>,” she told Us of her plans for the May holiday. “And all three of my kids are very different. They know I love it. So some are very short and sweet and some are very long. I just want to be around my husband and my kids.”</p><p>Cameron Bure’s apparel line with QVC is now available.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ6ZrqSxjJyYpp2ipLturtSrnKxlo6S7brjEr2SeppSoeqa6xpqenqWVo8FutMSsZKCqlZbBcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
