Life in France was a natural choice for the French singer and model – who shares two grown up children:&nbsp;<strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Lily-Rose Depp</a></strong>, 24, and&nbsp;<strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jack Depp</a></strong>, 21, with her former partner.</p><p id=eeBWCET65Iyh data-wc=56>But it may come as a surprise to fans to learn that it was Johnny – who <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>now resides in the UK</a></strong> – who owned the property, and what a property it was! The family's impressive Cote d'Azure mansion was set within a 19th century hamlet which belonged entirely to the star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9e6b843f3c32-johnny-depp-vanessa-paradis-french-home-3.jpg><p id=eRLlq4mfYAbQ data-wc=41>The house itself boasted an ample 15 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, two swimming pools and a skate park which was designed by the star for his son to play in. It also reportedly featured a themed wine cellar.</p><p id=e7yzk9GQHzzX data-wc=58>In addition, the surrounding area of the mansion featured a restaurant, village church, and guest house which was all also under the ownership of the now 60-year-old actor, who bought the then-abandoned village in 2001. The actor dedicated a lot of time and several million dollars to renovating the area, which he and his family eventually moved&nbsp;to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/abbc81ce2fa5-johnny-depp-vanessa-paradis-french-home-2.jpg><p id=eCU9oO7WwOt9 data-wc=39>After the couple split in 2012, Johnny eventually put the estate on sale in 2015. However, the impressive area which has been listed since at prices ranging from $27 million to over $60 million appears never to have sold.</p><p id=e02g5nGmaB data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Johnny Depp donates Amber Heard's $1 million settlement money to five different charities</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c7e82dbbf843-johnny-depp-vanessa-paradis-french-home-1.jpg><p id=ehAgNESlhOd3 data-wc=52>Another aspect which came along with the Hollywood star's property were its surrounding ancient woodlands, olive tree fields and vineyards. In 2007, it was revealed Johnny had bought Vanessa her very own vineyard near their home as a congratulations present for completing her new album, , which she released later that year.</p><h2><strong>Where else has Johnny Depp lived?</strong></h2><p id=eRyFtv94v5U7 data-wc=63>In addition to the pair's French village, Johnny, Vanessa and their children also spent some time living together on star's 150-foot luxury yacht. The actor named the boat after his family, taking the first two letters of each of their names in order to spell 'Vajoliroja' – likely a clever reference also to the famous pirate flag, the Jolly Roger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/8dff7586136d-gettyimages-1492435123.jpg><p id=e5Im0TTd_c74 data-wc=59><strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Other properties</a></strong> which the actor has owned in the past include: five Hollywood Hills-based mansions which neighbors each other, and which the star has turned into a private compound; several LA-based penthouses which he reportedly sold following his split from his ex-wife <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Amber Heard</a></strong> in 2016; and a Kentucky horse farm which he gifted to his mother.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Get a glimpse inside one of the actor's Hollywood homes</figure><p id=etH3D5Fk3y9n data-wc=48>The controversial famous face now values the privacy he finds when he spends time in his UK-based home, a 12 bedroom mansion based <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>in the Somerset countryside</a></strong>. Speaking with a local magazine, <strong></strong>, about his home there in 2023, Johnny explained: "I just love places with character."</p><p id=efyjonYQCqzf data-wc=69>He later went on to say how much he valued the culture he found there regarding how people reacted if they recognised him out and about town. "British people are cool and will greet you as if you are a neighbour," he said, before highlighting how the lack of an "over the top" greeting from fans helped as he is "not the great extrovert that people think" he is.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
