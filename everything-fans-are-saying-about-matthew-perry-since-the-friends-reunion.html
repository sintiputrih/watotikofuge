Slurred speech is a big symptom of a stroke, so fans were worried something was wrong. However, his team confirmed that the day of the reunion Perry had to have an emergency tooth procedure, which impacted his well-being. He had been in a lot of pain.</p><h2 id=he-looks-sick><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Looks Sick</span></h2><p>However, fans noticed not only was he slurring his speech, but he also just looked sick in the trailer and in his Instagram post promoting the new shirts and hoodies for the reunion that he looked unwell. Perry has had a lot of problems in the past, so fans were worried he relapsed again. But he is not sick after all. In fact, he is just aging, like everyone does when they get older.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drugs-and-alcohol-have-taken-a-toll><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Drugs And Alcohol Have Taken A Toll</span></h2><p>It is a well-known fact that Matthew Perry has struggled with drugs and alcohol.

At one point in the interview, Matthew Perry slurred his words again and one fans tweeted, "It pains me to see Matthew Perry like this, he just seems off, gazing at the void, speaking slowly.‚Äù Another fan wrote that they were sad and "scared like hell for Matthew Perry." It's nice to see fans concerned, but making wrong assumptions can take a toll on someone.</p><h2 id=he-looks-so-great-and-healthy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Looks So Great And Healthy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other side of things, one fan took to Twitter with a picture from PEOPLE magazine to say he "he looks so great and healthy. They all look amazing!" When the show ended in 2004, they were all still in their 30's at the prime of their careers and lives. They've all aged significantly.

People age and "Matthew has been through a lot since Friends wrapped."</p><p>And they're right. Even though fans didn't know he had a procedure on his mouth that same day, it's not right to spread rumors and be judgmental because it could cause him to relapse again, especially if he sees the comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Surprising Things About Matthew Perry's Time On 'Friends'&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=he-s-being-insensitive-over-merchandise><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He's Being Insensitive Over Merchandise</span></h2><p>To celebrate to reunion, Matthew Perry partnered with "Represent" to release some limited edition Chandler Bing/Friends merch. But some fans found it insensitive. Because he had a shirt that said 'Could I BE Anymore Vaccinated?' making a spoof on how Chandler emphasized the BE when he talked. Fans found it insensitive and thought he was making fun of COVID and the 100,000s of people who lost their lives. Other fans came to his defense and bought the shirts as soon as they got their shots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-grateful><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Be Grateful</span></h2><p>Because Perry has been through a lot, fans on Twitter are telling the ones who are putting him down to be grateful that he is even at the reunion and that he is alive to be here. People are just concerned about his looks, when the man has aged like the rest of the cast, and they don't really know what he has gone through or is going through. They just want fans to be grateful that he even got to come and do this. Be sure to tune into HBO Max to watch the six friends reunite.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry And David Schwimmer Have Been Up To Since Friends Ended</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZJ%2BZnqh6or7EZqqasZmjtG6twaisrWWdlsG1tMSwZKmdoqfGbr%2FIp5qeZaSdsm6y0aKcp5yjYr%2Bmwc2ipqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
