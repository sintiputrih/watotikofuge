She is probably best known for her breakthrough role in the Academy Award-winning film “American Beauty”(1999), and later in “Ghost World”(2001), “Dark Corners”(2006), “Train”(2008) and “Winter of Frozen Dreams”(2009).</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Thora Birch is? According to sources, it has been estimated that Thora Birch’s overall net worth is $8 million, acquired through a successful acting career which she started while still a child. She has appeared in numerous films and television shows, which significantly increased her net worth. Since she is still very active in the entertainment industry, her net worth continues to grow.</p><h3>Thora Birch Net Worth $8 Million</h3><p>Thora was the eldest child of former adult film actors Jack and Carol Birch, who have managed her career since the start. As a child during the late ‘80s, Birch began appearing in advertisements for “Burger King”, “Quaker Oats” and “California Raisins” among others, then made her film debut in “Purple People Eater” in 1988, in a role which brought her a Youth In Film Award. She then appeared in “Paradise” with <a href=#>Don Johnson</a>, <a href=#>Melanie Griffith</a> and <a href=#>Elijah Wood</a>, and continued acting during the ‘90s, starring in “All I Want for Christmas”, “Hocus Pocus”, “Monkey Trouble”, “Patriot Games”, “Clear and Present Danger” and “Now and Then”, all of which helped establish her net worth.</p><p>In 1996 she was cast in the leading role in the action-adventure film “Alaska”, after which she took a break from acting. She returned three years later, portraying the role of Jane Burnham in “American Beauty”, and being nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award, and earning several accolades including the Screen Actors Guild Award and Young Artist Award. Thora next appeared in supporting roles in “The Smokers” and “Dungeons and Dragons”, and in 2001 landed the lead role alongside <a href=#>Keira Knightley</a> in the horror film “The Hole”.</p><p>The same year, she was cast opposite <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a> in another lead role in “Ghost World”, and her performance brought her a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. Thora’s Emmy Award nomination came in 2003 for playing in “Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story”. She again appeared in horror films in “Dark Corners” and then in the 2008 slasher “Train”, portraying the leading role. Her net worth continued to rise.</p><p>When it comes to her more recent ventures, Birch played the lead character and produced the comedy-drama film “Petunia” in 2012, and after dedicating some time to her academic studies, she returned to acting three years later with a recurring role in the TV series “Colony”. During 2017, Thora is set to star in four films, including “The Etruscan Smile” and “Above Suspicion”.</p><p>Thora manages to keep her private life away from the public eyes, so there aren’t many details known. However, when it comes to her love life, she has had two public relationships, one with singer <a href=#>Fred Durst</a> and the other with <a href=#>Bill Maher</a>.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=23.194162436548><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Thora Birch</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 11, 1982</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.63 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Carol Connors, Jack Birch</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Bolt Birch</td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/1107miss</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000301/</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Awards</td><td>Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, Young Hollywood Award for Best Onscreen Chemistry, Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, Young Hollywood Talent for Charity Award</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie, BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, MTV Movie Award for Best Dressed, MTV Movie Award for Best Line, Satellite Award for Best...</td></tr><tr readability=21><td>Movies</td><td>American Beauty, Ghost World, Hocus Pocus, Now and Then, Monkey Trouble, The Hole, Patriot Games, Winter of Frozen Dreams, Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story, Clear and Present Danger, All I Want for Christmas, Dungeons & Dragons, Dark Corners, The Pregnancy Pact, Alaska, Petunia, Purple Peop...</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Parenthood, Day by Day</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=24.209277807064><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>I just felt like I was making people angry, because I wouldn't wear the frilly bows.

The actor in question explained that he was following directions from the play's director. Reportedly, he told the actor, "Listen, man, I'm trying to make this easier on you - don't touch her".
