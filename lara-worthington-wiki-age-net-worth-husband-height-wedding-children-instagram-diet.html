She is known for appearing in the 2006 Tourism Australia advertising campaign So where the bloody hell are you? Her own reality television series, Being Lara Bingle, premiered on Network Ten in June 2012, ending after one season. Lara has been featured on the cover of Australian Harper’s Bazaar, Elle, Grazia, Oyster, and Cleo. She has also appeared in episodes of Home and Away as well as The Celebrity Apprentice Australia and Australia’s Next Top Model. She competed on the Nine Network’s celebrity ice dancing show Torvill and Dean’s Dancing on Ice, where she was the last woman to be eliminated, resulting in coming runner-up in the series, and in the channel’s ad for the 2006-2007 Ashes series. Nine re-hired Worthington in 2008 as a reporter for a new travel show, Holidays for Sale.</p><p>She signed a one-year deal in 2008 with international phone company Vodafone as one of their official ambassadors. Worthington signed a three-year contract (2008–2011) with swimwear brand Speedo. Since 2009, Worthington has been an Ambassador for Bowel Cancer Australia. On 4 June 2010, Worthington officially launched 2010, “Love My Family” ad campaign. In August 2010, Worthington announced that she had signed with US model agency Elite Models. Lara was announced as a contestant in the 2011 series of Dancing with the Stars.[10] The series began airing in May. She was partnered with Carmelo Pizzino. Following her elimination from Dancing with the Stars on 26 June 2011, Bingle told The Kyle and Jackie O Show that she was shocked and upset at having been kicked off the show, given her competitive streak.</p><p>In December 2011, it was announced that Worthington had signed a development deal with Network Ten to star in her own reality television series. Ten commissioned a 10-episode reality television series. The series focuses on both Worthington’s personal and professional life. For the series, Worthington relocated to an $8 million Bondi apartment in the hope of making the series more appealing for potential overseas TV buyers. The series Being Lara Bingle premiered on 12 June 2012 to over 925,000 viewers, exceeding expectations, but met with mixed reviews from critics, resulting in the show only lasting one season. In January 2012, Worthington signed as a brand ambassador for coconut water brand H2Coco. She featured in a photoshoot in tropical Bali to kick off the brand’s advertising campaign in Australia. Lara has served as the face of the Australian fashion chain Cotton On. In November 2014, Worthington launched a new tanning range called The Base. In 2019, Worthington’s beauty brand became not for profit and re-branded as Share The Base. She dropped out of school at 16 to move to Italy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lara-worthington-age></span> Lara Worthington Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She was born on June 22 1987 in Cronulla, Australia.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lara-worthington-husband></span> Lara Worthington Husband<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is married to her husband, Sam Worthington since 2014.
