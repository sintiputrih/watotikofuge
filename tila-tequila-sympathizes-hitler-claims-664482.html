However, those of you with a closed mind can think I am being anti-Semite [sic] all you want because I already told you that I am not, nor will I repeat myself again.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>EXCLUSIVE: The Chilling History of How Hollywood Helped Hitler</a></strong></p><p>In fact, she suggests that the victims of a war should get over it, writing “What do you think war is about? People DIE in wars that is why I am against wars…&nbsp;I understand the Jewish people went through some shit too, but hey guess what?? SO DID THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED IN EVERY SINGLE WAR THST [sic] TOOK PLACE! You were NOT the only ones! So please, if the rest of us can forgive and forget maybe it’s time you do also!!!”</p><p>Tequila instead claims that she’s exposing the truth about Hitler, noting that when she viewed him as “an atrocious monster” she was “merely brainwashed” by movies and the media.</p><p>Instead, she praises Hitler for trying to help Germany and its citizens.</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: The Films Nazis Loved and Hated</a></strong></p><p>“He was not a bad person as they have painted him out to be. Not even close!!!” she writes. “Here is a man who was not a coward, stood up for his country in a DESPERATE TIME OF NEED (unlike all of our cowardly leaders), and yet not only did he try his best to help his country and people get out of what was a time of depression, economic collapse, high unemployment, amongst many other things… he lost the war AND was painted out to be a monster after his death. This is what breaks my heart. “</p><p>Tequila continues: “Hitler was a good man and it takes some f—ing balls for someone to say this out loud this day and age, especially for a public figure like myself, but you know what? SOMEONE NEEDS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH WITHOUT FEAR! Otherwise the dark cabal who currently control the world and all of the world bankers will continue to feed you their lies, feed off your emotions, take advantage of your emotions and will continue to keep you THEIR SLAVE!”</p><p>She also claims Hitler didn’t want a worldwide genocide or to eliminate Jewish people and wishes the U.S. had a leader like Hitler.</p><p>“AMERICA IS FALLING AT THE MOMENT YET I DO NOT SEE ANYONE IN OFFICE *AHEM* THAT IS BRAVE ENOUGH TO SAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LIKE HITLER WAS WILLING TO SAVE THE GERMAN PEOPLE!” she writes. “God knows Americans sure do need a TRUE HERO right now but as long as we are still living in a nation that is still stuffing their faces with GMO, Still asleep watching crap TV, still getting brainwashed by media, still being poisoned and not giving a f—. I highly doubt any President here would give a f— about saving our country either. ONLY WE CAN SAVE OURSELVES NOW OR BRING IN A NEW LEADER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I should just run for office for f—‘s sake!”</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Paul Walker’s Career in Pictures</a></strong></p><p>She pledged to continue revealing the “true story about what REALLY happened in WWII” via her blog.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel=nofollow>more recent blog post</a>, she describes what she believes to be the true history of the Jewish people, saying the Eastern European Jews were originally a warlike tribe called the Khazars who were also “phallic worshippers,” undercutting her initial claims of not being anti-Semitic.</p><p>In this and other posts on her blog and Facebook page, Tequila argued that she’s merely espousing the truth and urged people to wake up to that reality. She also made outrageous statements about other subjects, including arguing that <a href=# rel=nofollow>“the official 9/11 story is bullshit”</a> and claiming <a href=# rel=nofollow>on her Facebook page</a> that <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_paul-walker data-tag=paul-walker>Paul Walker</a></strong>‘s death was a “ritualistic murder.”</p><p>Tequila says she has resolved the mystery of who killed<strong> Elisa Lam</strong>, a woman who was found dead in a downtown&nbsp;L.A. hotel’s water tank in February, saying, “It was indeed a ritualistic murder. Just like Paul Walker’s.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOraClmV2psrLByKWYZqupor2iwMeisZ6rXZ22tbjEq2ScpJGeurR5lW9rbXBiZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
