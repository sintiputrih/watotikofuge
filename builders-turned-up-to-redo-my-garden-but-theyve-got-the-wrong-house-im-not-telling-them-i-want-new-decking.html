You have the wrong house! Oh no, you have the wrong house,” Chloe can be heard saying from behind her closed door, in her first clip.</p><p>“This is a huge mess up,” she continues but not loud enough for them to hear.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FABULOUS BINGO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JOIN NOW FOR £1,000 DAILY FREE BINGO</a></strong></p><p>In a follow up clip, Chloe added: “Well, they’re at the wrong house but I’m not going to stop them because I’d love to have free concrete – or a deck, whatever they’re building.

I want whatever they’re doing down, and then I’m going to be, like, ‘Wrong house!'”</p><p>Updating her followers on the progress so far, the homeowner claimed she still had no idea what they were building in her garden saying it was still going to be a surprise to her.</p><p>“It’s a complete surprise because they’re at the wrong house, right?” she said. “So if you know what this is going to be – it’s all stone – let me know.”</p><p>While it’s not known how serious Chloe is or if her claims are true, many found the incident hilarious.</p><p>However some didn’t believe Chloe and said refusing to pay would be considered theft – but she reassured everyone she would end up paying.</p><p>“Sorry to tell you that what you’re doing is illegal because you could’ve stopped them before it happened,” one user commented.</p><p>Meanwhile, another added: “The fact that y’all believe this is real is hilarious…”</p><p>Meanwhile, this <a href=#>couple transform their ‘awful and wet’ patio into their dream space using £4 Dunelm and B&M bargains</a></p><p>And&nbsp;<a href=#>thrifty couple transform drab garden into dream outdoor space&nbsp;</a>with epic DIY decking job & it saved them over £1,000.</p><p>Plus, this&nbsp;<a href=#>thrifty couple turn their rotten decking into a dream pergola</a>&nbsp;and it’s all thanks to £3.99 eBay bargains.</p><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Painting hack goes viral as savvy TikToker shows off deck painting trick</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkqq2rbDEq6pmrKWnu6awjK6nZqyfYr%2BmsM5mpLJll5a%2FpbHNZpmurF2ptabF1Z5koKekYsGpsYywqaiml2K1sMHSnmSipV2jvLV5056jpaGenHq1tMSmZKJlp5a7tXnNnq5mnJWYuKq6xmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
