Although he began his professional career in 2022, Shelton has already jumped many places to find himself in the top 20. If he keeps going in the same manner, he is likely to land in the top 10 soon. Currently in the Japan Open, Shelton is in the semifinal and set to face his opponent, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Marcos Giron</a>.</span></p><p><span>Giron is standing between Shelton and a chance at his first ATP 500. For Giron, Shelton is the opponent he has to beat to reach his first ATP 500 final.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Ben Shelton vs Marcos Giron: Preview</span></strong></h2><p><span>Shelton started the year with a bang as he beat player after player to reach the quarterfinal of the Australian Open. He was defeated by Tommy Paul, and since then, his season has been inconsistent.</span><span> Since the Australian Open, he has been unable to advance further than round 2 in any Masters or slams before the US Open.</span></p><p><span>As the American slam came into the fray, he turned his season around and made his way to the semifinal. He then stepped into Shanghai and played well till the quarterfinal, only to be ousted by Sebastian Korda. He also fought hard in the Laver Cup, and his efforts won his team the trophy.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023-01-15T012829Z_1632785278_UP1EJ1F043F2A_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-AUSOPEN.jpg><p><span>Giron, on the other hand, achieved his best result in the French Open this year. Although he played well, he was eliminated in round three. Besides Roland Garros, he could not go further than round 2 in all Masters and slams.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Despite a rocky season, he has turned it around in the Japan Open, where he has managed to beat a top 10 player. Now, the 30-year-old has a shot at his first final in the ATP Tour, and he will face Shelton.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Giron vs Shelton: Head-to-Head</span></strong></h2><p><span>The two American players have faced each other once. They fought earlier this year in the Delray Open in the first round, where Giron was the victor. The veteran American player did not give a single set to his opponent as he beat him in straight sets.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Reaffirming week for Marcos Giron. The former UCLA star qualified in Tokyo and beat Ruud & Auger-Aliassime to reach the semifinals where he'll face Ben Shelton in an all-American, all-college-tennis duel<a href=#>#getty</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NYELuN52bQ</a></p><p>â€” Christopher Clarey ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ (@christophclarey) <a href=#>October 20, 2023</a></p><p><span>While their statistics were close in all regards, Giron broke Sheltonâ€™s serve twice to break the rhythm of his opponent. The scoreboard read 6-4, 6-4 for Giron after he moved on to round two of the tournament.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Prediction: Shelton to win in three sets</span></strong></h2><p><span>Shelton has had a great season since the American slam rolled around. The 21-year-old player has beaten two top 10 players, which has given his confidence an immense boost. He lacked the energy to go big when the final stages came around, but he came back after losing the first set of his first two matches in the Japan Open. Now, his eyes are on the big trophy.</span></p><p><span>Giron has put on great performances this season and fought through the first two qualifying rounds to find himself in the semifinal of the Japan Open. He brings intense energy, as he has only dropped one set so far. But his overall performance might not match up to the new and reformed Shelton. What are your predictions for the bout?
