CeCe Moore has also worked as a consultant on many TV programs, including The Today Show, 60 Minutes, 20/20, and The Doctors, among others. Moreover, she is most known for co-hosting the PBS television series Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr. as a DNA specialist.</h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>CeCe was born in the United States on <strong>January 15, 1969.</strong> She is now <strong>52 years old</strong>. Michael Moore and Janis Proctor are her parents. She was raised in Rancho Bernardo, San Diego’s North Country, with three siblings. She is the youngest of three siblings, with two older sisters and a younger brother. Moore is of American descent, but her race is still being investigated.</p><p>She went to Mt. Carmel High School for her secondary education. She also earned a full scholarship to the University of Southern California, where she majored in theater, animation, and vocal performance.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>CeCe has also spent almost two decades in the film industry as a commercials performer since becoming a producer and casting director. She selects genetic genealogy as her third occupation after almost reaching her forties. She used DNA to help people trace their direct families. Similarly, she unveiled the real identity of the man who was abducted from his mother’s arms in a Chicago hospital in 1964 and raised as Paul Fronczak in 2005. Moore was discovered in Michigan in 2019 by a team of Moore’s hereditary genealogists.</p><p>In 2015, her team discovered amnesiac Benjaman Kyle’s real identity as William Burgess Powell. She found out that LL Cool J’s mother was adopted the same year. She was also able to recognize his paternal grandparents and introduce him to his 90-year-old biological maternal grandmother through DNA research.</p><p>Moore has since started a Facebook page for adoptees called DNA Detectives, which uses their DNA to help find their birth families. She has joined Parabon NanoLabs in 2018 as the head of their genetic genealogy team. She has aided police officials in the resolution of several high-profile identity incidents to date.</p><h4><span>Net worth</span></h4><p>Moore may have amassed a sizable fortune over the course of her lifetime. However, she has yet to announce her true <strong>net worth</strong>, wage, or annual profits in the mainstream. Full-time genealogists, on the other hand, receive an average of $71,428 a year.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>CeCe Moore is a <strong>married</strong> woman and has a son named Paul Fronczak, whom she adopted as a child.
