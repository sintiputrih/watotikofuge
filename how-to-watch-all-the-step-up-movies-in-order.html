Focusing on the same story of dancers from different backgrounds, the film had a better reception than the first but still suffered from negative reviews. However, it was a huge box-office success, grossing over $150 million dollars.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>The film is available to stream for free on YouTube Movies (but prepare for some ads along the way).&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-step-up-3d data-injectable=false>Step Up 3D</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>The highest-grossing film in the Step Up franchise, Step Up 3D featured Rick Malambri and Sharni Vinson as the lead dance couple in the film.
