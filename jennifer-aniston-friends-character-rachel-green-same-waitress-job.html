As it turns out, the actor who played the beloved character, <a href=# class=T3D>Jennifer Aniston</a>, had a very similar career path to Rachel before starring in the hit series.</p><p>Speaking to InStyle back in 2019, <a href=# class=T3D>The Morning Show</a> star opened up about <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the early days of her post-Friends fame</a>, revealing that, like Rachel Green, she had previously worked as a waitress in the Big Apple. “I was such a grown-up by then,” Aniston recalled. “I had moved away from home. I had been on six failed television shows. I waitressed for years in New York before I got anything.”</p><p>However, that wasn’t her only pre-Friends gig. The actor went on to share that she also once worked as a telemarketer selling time-shares in the Poconos. “I didn't make one sale,” she added. “I was terrible at it. I was like, ‘Why do we have to call people at dinnertime?’” Before that, Aniston “cut hair for 10 bucks a head” in junior high. “I cut my dad’s hair, and he was on a soap opera [<i>Days of Our Lives</i>]. But then he admitted to me 15 years ago that he would go in and have the hairdresser on set clean it up.”</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Gary Null/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images</p></figure><p>This isn’t the only time Aniston has reminisced on her early Friends fame in recent years, having previously revealed that she <a href=# class=T3D>once stole a Monica Geller dress</a> from co-star Courteney Cox’s dressing room, disclosed how she was <a href=# class=T3D>originally cast in the hit ’90s sitcom</a>, and <a href=# class=T3D>recalled the first major purchase she made</a> with her Friends paycheck — which she still regrets to this day.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqOdnqO2p7HRZpinoaOpvK95xaugnqaUqHqktMCrmJyslad6s63CoZylZZensqa6jKyYpp1drK6qwNGeqqxlmqSv</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
