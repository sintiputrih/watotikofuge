But can she act? Let's investigate!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Stop the presses! We have news! It was announced today through a teaser trailer that <a href=#>Kim Kardashian </a>is going to be on Season 12 of <a href=#>American Horror Story.</a> Yes, you read that right. The one and only Kim Kardashian.</p><p>Now, we know what you're wondering: Can Kim Kardashian act? And the answer to that is, well, maybe? You may be surprised that this is not an outright no, but she has been in quite a few projects. True it was mostly playing herself. But still!</p><p>So, let's get to the bottom of this, shall we?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can Kim Kardashian act?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span><p>Kim Kardashian</p></figure><p>When you ask the question "Can Kim Kardashian act?", you can't help but immediately think of when she hosted <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> last season and kinda killed it. The girl was self-aware, self-deprecating, and wasn't afraid to go for it in the sketches.</p><p>During her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">monologue</a> she jokes, "I haven't had a movie premiere in a really long time. And actually, I only had that one movie come out and no one told me it was even premiering," alluding to her infamous sex tape.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube</span><p>The People's Kourt - SNL</p></figure><p>In "The People's Kourt" sketch, Kim plays her sister Kourtney as a judge on a TV court show. If you've seen The Kardashians before, (which let's be real, is probably all of us), then you know that this impression is pretty spot on.</p><p>But this is not Kim's first rodeo on the small screen. She has been in multiple projects such as How I Met Your Mother, Brothers, Last Man Standing, 30 Rock, and 2 Broke Girls, just to name a few. She might have played herself in all of those projects, but hey! She had lines. She had blocking. That ain't nothing.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube</span><p>PAW PATROL: The Movie Clip - Chase Meets Dolores (2021)</p></figure><p>Kim has had roles as well! She had four episode stints on both Beyond the Break and Drop Dead Diva. But her biggest role has to be voicing Delores, the sassy standard poodle in Paw Patrol: The Movie.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Kim Kardashian playing in 'American Horror Story' Season 12?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kim Kardashian (@kimkardashian)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span><p>Kim Kardashian, 'American Horror Story'</p></figure><p>Not much is known about Season 12 of American Horror Story. On April 10th, Kim posted a teaser trailer that reads, "Emma Roberts... and... Kim Kardashian...are... DELICATE," set to the tune of a creepy rendition of "Rockabye Baby." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> reported that same day that the role she is playing was, "written just for her."</p><p>Ryan Murphy gave <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> more details on Kim's role saying, "Kim is among the biggest and brightest television stars in the world and we are thrilled to welcome her to the AHS family... Halley Feiffer has written a fun, stylish, and ultimately terrifying role, especially for Kim, and this season is ambitious and unlike anything we have ever done."</p><p>The Variety article went into more detail about the season stating that it is, "Reportedly, it’s at least somewhat based on Danielle Valentine’s upcoming novel, Delicate Condition...a cover blurb from author Andrea Bartz describes Delicate Condition as “the feminist update to Rosemary’s Baby we all needed." Wait...does Kim give birth to the Anti-Christ? We'll have to wait and see.</p><p>American Horror Story Season 12 is set to premiere sometime this summer. We don't know about you, but we have a feeling that it's going to be very good. We will obviously be tuning in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vecqipGajkaexor%2FHopinZZGYwQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
