Steve, who plays Jason Morgan, revealed in an Instagram video on November 23 that he’s been “let go” from the long-running daytime series because he chose not to comply with the show’s vaccine mandate. <strong>HollywoodLife has reached out to ABC for additional comment.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I wanted you to hear it from me personally,” he said. “Unfortunately, General Hospital has let me go because of the vaccine mandate. I did apply for my medical and religious exemptions, and both of those were denied. Which, you know, hurts. But this is also about personal freedom to me. I don’t think anybody should lose their livelihood over this.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite being let go from the show he’s called home for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>nearly 3 decades</a>, Steve has no hard feelings about what’s happened. He hopes to return to General Hospital in the future. His character was last seen getting caught in a tunnel collapse on Cassadine Island.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“But with that being said, I’ll always be grateful for my time at General Hospital,” he continued. “I love it there. I grew up there. I grew up with some of you, so I’ll always be grateful. And I believe that when one door closes, multiple doors open. That’s always been my perspective. So I am excited to see what the future brings, and maybe one day if these mandates are lifted, I can return and finish my career as Jason Morgan. That would be an honor. And if not, I’m going to take this amazing experience, move forward, and be forever grateful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Steve-Burton-General-Hospital-abc-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>General Hospital’s vaccine mandate took effect on November 1, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. All cast and crew in Zone A were required to be vaccinated at the start of the month.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Steve tested positive for COVID-19 in August 2021. At the time, the actor said he’d been “exposed at work.” Just weeks before Steve’s confirmation that he’d been let go, his General Hospital co-star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ingo Rademacher</strong></a> was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>also let go</a> because of his refusal to comply with the show’s vaccine mandate. His exit was confirmed amid backlash to a transphobic meme and anti-vax messaging Ingo posted online. Ingo’s last episode aired on November 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FsZqyslauybq7Uq6uopl2btrOxw2aenqaVp66teceoqqmhpJa5bsLAnJqippViuqK6w5qrnmWcmsFus85moZqrn6N6rrvRoJinZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
