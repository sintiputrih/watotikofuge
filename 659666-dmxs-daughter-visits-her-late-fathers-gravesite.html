The Ruff Ryder's legend first hit the scene as a features artist. However, he would quickly go on to establish himself as a solo act. The New York native's lyricism and aggressive demeanor earned him fans the world over. Subsequently, he became one of the biggest rappers of his era. Additionally, his popularity led him to starring in movies such as Cradle 2 The Grave and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Romeo</a> Must Die. However, for 10-year-old Sonovah Hamilton, he was simply her dad.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Hamilton was only eight-years-old when her father died. However, it's obvious X made a life-long impact on his daughter. Hamilton recently took to Instagram to share a touching tribute to her father on the two-year anniversary of his death. In the photo, Hamilton can be seen smiling in front of her X's headstone. Additionally, she's wearing a shirt with her father's image on it. Hamilton captioned the photo with "Couldnâ€™t pull up to yo city and not see you. Hey daddy!"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-dmx-leaves-behind-an-enormous-legacy>DMX Leaves Behind An Enormous Legacy</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, other tributes have been coming in for X as well. The Ruff Ryders paid tribute to their fallen comrade <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">earlier this week. </a>The crew is a loosely affiliated group of New York rappers that X was the de-fact leader of. The group and a small number of fans gathered at X's gravesite on Sunday. During the tribute, speakers shared stories about the impact X had on their lives and careers. Additionally, attendees could be seen reciting lyrics and pouring out liquor for their friend.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">No one will ever understand the pain that DMX's death brought his friends and family. However, X's death had an impact on fans all around the world. Several fans have taken to social media to pay their respects to the beloved rapper. "R.I.P. DMX can't believe it's been 2 years already!!!" said one Twitter user. "Pour one out for the Dog!" said another. X had been open about his struggles with mental health issues and substance abuse. However, his death still shocked fans and artists across the world of hip-hop. But the story isn't over. Fans will continue being inspired by his work because although he may no longer be here, his music will live forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoZ3gpVmm6awo2KxosHGoaueql2rtrS106xkoZ2iYrmiwMRmnZqsmJq%2FtHnGq5ivnaOewaY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
