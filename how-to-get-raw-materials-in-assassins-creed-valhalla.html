In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, you start with the bare basics, a few buildings, and eager people wanting to work. To craft these structures, you need supplies and raw materials. You can find supplies all over England by looting chests and investigating random locations. The raw materials resource is much more distinct. You can only obtain those doing one thing, and that’s by raiding.</p><p data-injection=true>You and your clansman have to take to your longship and scour England, fighting conquerable targets. The larger the targets, the more resources, and supplies they’ll have on their location. To find a raidable location, open up your world map and look for a location with a pair of red axes crossing over each other, and you will be able to raid it to find raw materials.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/09020213/Raw-materials-850x478.jpg><p data-injection=true>These locations vary in power, so you may not want to start raiding up and down England until you progress through the story and increase Eivor’s overall power. Once you have enough, attack the location, and take out as many enemies as you can. While you’re fighting, use Odin’s Sight to find all of the lootable chests you can unearth inside the buildings. The better, more secure buildings will have doors you need to break down, typically hinting at having several useful resources you can secure inside.</p><p>You can always use your Odin’s Sight to verify you’ve looted everything. To double-check, open up the world map and look around for any wealth point of interest. These will have raw materials in them, so long as they are in the settlement you are raiding. There are several wealth points of interest all over the game.</p><p>After you’ve finished looting, return to Ravenstrope, secure your supplies, and start a new life with your clan. The more raids you conduct, the more raw materials you can use to develop new buildings and upgrades.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
