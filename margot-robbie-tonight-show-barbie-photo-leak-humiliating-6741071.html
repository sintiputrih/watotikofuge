But one person was definitely not feeling the good vibes: the star of the movie. Robbie appeared on&nbsp;The Tonight Show&nbsp;last night and spoke about how it was one of the most "humiliating" moments she'd ever had to endure.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can't tell you how mortified we were by the way," she told Jimmy Fallon of having those roller skating photos go viral. "We look like we're laughing, having fun, but dying on the inside. I was like, 'This is the most humiliating moment of my life.' So embarrassed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robbie went on to say that she wasn't prepared for just how popular the photos would become. Naysayers may point out that the photos were taken on the Venice Beach boardwalk, which isn't exactly low-key, but Robbie insists that she didn't think the photos, in all their neon glory, would have gotten so much attention.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I knew that we had some exteriors to shoot in L.A.," she added. "Once you're doing exteriors, you're gonna get papped. There's probably going to be a little crowd of people there who are gonna take notice because of the fluro â€” we stand out a little in those outfits. And so I knew there would be a little bit of attention and probably some photos would get out there but not like it did."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robbie added that "it was mad" that after the photos leaked, there would be hundreds of people coming to see the production in the subsequent days, hoping to get a glimpse of her and Gosling in their '80s athletic wear.&nbsp;Barbie&nbsp;arrives in theaters on July 21, 2023, but Robbie has plenty to keep fans happy until then. She'll appear in David O. Russell's&nbsp;Amsterdam&nbsp;later this year alongside Taylor Swift and Anya Taylor-Joy and also star in&nbsp;Babylon&nbsp;with Brad Pitt, Tobey Maguire, and Jean Smart.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJqpoKekYr%2BwrsGinGasn6O2qLTTZqqhp6dir6K%2BwaKcZqiYpMGwecuemKRlmKq6qrjImquippdig3iAkGluag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
