The show was on the bubble during last season’s fourth year. It was given an 18-episode order and was expected to end early this spring. However, after the show premiered to strong ratings, ABC gave <strong>Brothers & Sisters</strong> a full 22-episode commitment, giving hope to fans that the show could still live on.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>Since the full season order, <strong>Brothers & Sisters</strong> has slipped in the ratings with critics and fans alike believing that the show could be doomed. The writers have stated that the season finale will be a cliffhanger so a shortened season will help tie up loose plotlines.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>There are some caveats in bringing back the series. Most of the cast would have to reduce the number of episodes they appeared in (again), with <strong>Calista Flockhart</strong> only reportedly being in 6 of them. The episode order would be anywhere from 6 to 18 with a 13 minimum. If ABC doesn’t produce at least 13, they must renegotiate with each actor individually.</p><p data-characters=46 data-current-count=46 data-injectable=false>Stay tuned for the updates on the negotiation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yirsJmq5qkm6h6oq7Bq5yvoZGpsqV5waumraCVp8Buv8isq56qo2LAqsTToWSsnZGovK97</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
