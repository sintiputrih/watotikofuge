MJF is the current World Champion and has been booked very strongly as the champion. His current storyline features him feuding with the other Pillars of AEW and now it appears the identity of the person behind this current storyline has been revealed.</p><p>MJF is the AEW World Champion, and he is the central focus of every week’s episode of Dynamite. That is why for the past few weeks now, MJF has been feuding with Darby Allin, Sammy Guevara and Jungle Boy.</p><p>All three challengers want a piece of MJF right now for his AEW World Title, which has been the central focus of the ‘Four Pillars’ storyline in the company. It will culminate in a fatal four-way match at AEW Double Or Nothing on May 28th.</p><p>According to a report by <a href=#>Cassidy Haynes of BodySlam.net</a>, MJF is responsible for the ‘Four Pillars’ storyline for the AEW World Championship right now. Considering the quality of the angle, it makes sense MJF has been hands-on with it.</p><p>While speaking with sources inside AEW regarding the upcoming Double or Nothing PPV this weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada one of the topics discussed was the “Four Pillars” Match for the AEW World Championship. Sources relayed to me that the creative person responsible for writing the storyline for the entire “Four Pillars” World Championship program has been none other than AEW World Champion MJF.</p><p>As noted, MJF will be defending his AEW World Championship against Darby Allin, Sammy Guevara and Jungle Boy in the main event of AEW Double Or Nothing on May 28th. We’ll have to see whether The Salt Of The Earth will be able to successfully retain his title.</p><p>What’s your view on this MJF story?
