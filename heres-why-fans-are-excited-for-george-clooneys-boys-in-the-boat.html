Add a come from behind victory, and it’s pure satisfaction. That’s the premise of the upcoming film The Boys in the Boat, in the works since 2011 and is directed by award-winning actor George Clooney.Not much has been said about the historical drama except for some revelation about casting. Due to limited information, fans are on their toes on what to expect from this exciting movie. The film is based on the nonfiction book of Daniel James Brown titled The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.The novel, published by Penguin Books in 2013, is about the victory of the University of Washington rowing team who represented the United States in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany – a golden feat for the country at a time when many are struggling because of the Great Depression.The inspiring story is fit for Hollywood and fans are excited about this period drama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-boys-in-the-boat-about>What Is 'Boys In The Boat' About?</h2><p>The book’s main character is Joseph ‘Joe’ Rantz. He was interviewed by the author, Brown, upon learning that he was the father of his neighbor. That neighbor approached Brown to tell him that his dad is a fan of his works and wanted to meet him. Rantz shared to the writer his experiences during the economic depression and his stint as a UW rower.</p><p>For the book, Brown focused on the preparation of the team before the big game. Alongside Rantz were rowers Herbert Morris, Charles Day, Gordon Adam, John White, James ‘Stub’ McMillin, George ‘Shorty’ Hunt, Donald Hume, and coxswain Robert Moch. They were coached by Al Ulbrickson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s expected that much of the movie will focus on the build-up to the race, just like the Brown narration. The film might also employ the two backstories of the novel: the first one being the struggles of the nine students during the economic crisis, which threatened their education.</p><p>The second is about Nazi Germany's construction of the Olympic venues while they allegedly covered up their abuses against the Jews to curry favor from the international community as they organize the sporting event.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These 10 George Clooney Movies Made Over $150 Million</a></span></p><h2 id=production-and-release-date>Production And Release Date</h2><p>The Weinstein Company acquired the film rights for the book as early as 2011, even before its publication two years later. It was originally laid on the table of award-winning director <a href=#>Kenneth Branagh, who is directing a sci-fi movie</a>, and producer Donna Gigliotti.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It remained in limbo until 2018 when Lantern Entertainment (successor of The Weinstein Company) partnered with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the movie's distribution. Two more years without an update, it was announced that Clooney will take over as director. 2021 saw Clooney busy on the director’s chair of The Tender Bar, so The Boys in the Boat remained in the backseat.</p><p>However, that same year saw more names popping up as part of the movie: Clooney’s co-director is his Smokehouse Pictures partner Grant Heslov, Mark L. Smith will work on the screenplay, and Chris Weitz revisited a previous draft. SpyGlass is the executive producer. Moreover, British actor Callum Turner was announced as the first star to be cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the movie is still deep in development, there's no mention of a release date, but it is expected to be in two years, maybe 2023. This, while <a href=#>Clooney is still busy with the romantic comedy film Ticket to Paradise</a>, which is set to be released in late 2022. And nobody knows if the production team and cast are already complete.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>George Clooney Refused To Return To 'ER' For This Fantastic Reason</a></span></p><h2 id=who-will-be-in-boys-in-the-boat>Who Will Be In 'Boys In The Boat'?</h2><p>It is not yet known if Callum Turner will be playing the main character. The BAFTA-nominated actor had his breakout role in the thriller Green Room. According to <a href=#>Turner's IMDB profile</a>, he has appeared in numerous films like Assassin's Creed, Victor Frankenstein, and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>February 2022 ushered in new updates for the film. Joining Turner are Hadley Robinson, Joel Edgerton, Wil Coban, Jack Mulhern, Bruce Herbelin-Earle, Sam Strike, Tom Varey, Thomas Elms, and Luke Slattery.</p><p>Robinson is known for her roles in the blockbuster hit Little Women, television show Utopia, and Moxie. Meanwhile, Edgerton, who is the veteran among the cast, starred in a couple of Star Wars films, The Great Gatsby, <a href=#>King Arthur (which actually lost Warner Bros money)</a>, and Zero Dark Thirty. The Australian was also the director of the award-winning The Gift.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>George Clooney Had Expensive Demands For Starring In 'Gravity'</a></span></p><p>Coban was recently part of Zack Snyder’s Justice League while Mulhern starred in the HBO series Mare of Eastown. Another young actor in the mix is model Herbelin-Earle, known for his stint in Netflix drama Free Rein. English actor Strike, on the other hand, is best known for his role in the BBC series EastEnders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ridley Road's Varey, Elms of Timeless, and Slattery from Steven Spielberg’s The Post are all part of the crew. March 2022 revealed two more celebrities joining the team: Courtney Henggeler and James Wolk.</p><p>Henggeler was part of the TV series The Big Bang Theory, Jane the Virgin, and Cobra Kai, plus movies Friends with Benefits and Nobody's Fool. Wolk, however, is known for his roles in The Crazy Ones, Mad Men, Zoo, and Watchmen. The team is getting packed, so expect more revelations from the production.</p><p>A documentary was already made in 2016 about the rowing team, giving the public not just a snapshot of their feat but taking viewers to the challenging and hostile situation the boys endured just so they can bring that gold home. The movie will help relive that moment of American pride, proving once more that victory is achieved through a determined spirit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>George Clooney Declares ‘I Was Offered $35 Million For One Day’s Work’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2Kus7GMnq%2BcoaSasW6yzqtkoJ2fp7SmecKlpqimla7Abq7OsqpmoZ5iwamxjJummqxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
