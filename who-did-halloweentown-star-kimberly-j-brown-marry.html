If enemies to lovers is your favorite trope in romance movies then you‚Äôll get a kick out of who Brown fell happily in love with after permanently opening the portal between the mortal world and Halloweentown.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-kimberly-j-brown-s-fiance-and-soon-to-be-husband data-injectable=false>Kimberly J.

The two former Halloweentown actors are currently engaged and in the process of planning their magical wedding.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Now, before you assume they immediately met and fell in love while filming Halloween II: Kalabar‚Äôs Revenge in 2001, think again. Brown actually revealed in a 2021 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video</a> that she and Kountz didn‚Äôt speak or reconnect for at least 10 years after filming the Disney Channel movie. It wasn‚Äôt until Brown reached out for a YouTube skit collaboration that the sparks started to fly.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true><a title=@officialkjb href=#>@officialkjb</a><p>Have i introduced you to my fianc√©e? <a title=isaidyes href=#>#isaidyes</a> üíç ‚ù§Ô∏è @danielkountz</p><a title="‚ô¨ Come and Get Your Love - Redbone" href=#>‚ô¨ Come and Get Your Love ‚Äì Redbone</a></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Nowadays, Brown and Kountz do a little less work in front of the camera, but they are by no means out of the public eye. In 2021, Brown appeared in 15 episodes of the popular American soap opera General Hospital, and in 2023 she lent her voice to the character Blair in the Disney Channel animated series The Ghost and Molly McGee.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Kountz is also still an actor ‚Äî in 2022 he voiced the character Byggvir in the popular video game God of War Ragnar√∂k.

Brown has already admitted to being open to doing another Halloweentown movie, and since Kal was never killed in Halloweentown II‚Ä¶ just sayin‚Äô ‚Äî it‚Äôs highly possible that these two would be willing to reprise their famous roles.
