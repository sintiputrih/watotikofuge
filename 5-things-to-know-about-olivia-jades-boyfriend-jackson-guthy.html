She is completely in hiding right now. Olivia is posting private Stories on Instagram, using the only-close-friends option, to share her days on social media with her close circle.”</p><p>Although the beauty guru’s friends are encouraging her to “not be mad at her parents since they were just trying to do the best they could for her,” she isn’t listening to them and she “feels she is the victim,” added the insider.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Who-Is-Jackson-Guthy-5-Things-to-Know-About-Olivia-Jade-Boyfriend.jpg><p>Olivia, who boasts nearly 2 million followers on YouTube, lost brand deals with TRESemme and Sephora after Loughlin, 54, and Giannulli, 55, allegedly paid $500,000 to secure her and older sister Bella, 20, admission into the University of Southern California as crew team recruits, even though they have never played the sport. The <i>Fuller House </i>star and the fashion designer <a href=#>appeared in federal court</a> in Boston on Wednesday, April 3, to face the charges nearly three weeks after they were arrested.</p><p>While Olivia “is still enrolled” at USC, the insider told <i>Us </i>that “she has physically withdrawn” due to fears of bullying. “She was passionate about her career and now everything she built has imploded before her eyes,” a second source told <i>Us</i>, noting that the social media star “<a href=#>blames her mom and dad for this scandal</a> and for the downfall of her career.”</p><p>Although the vlogger and Bella “were so close” to Loughlin before her alleged participation in Operation Varsity Blues made headlines, they are now “resentful” of her and Mossimo.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <i>90210 </i>alum is <a href=#>determined to fight for her freedom</a> and hasn’t come to terms with the fact that she could serve time behind bars. “Lori is in denial and doesn’t believe she should have to spend any time in prison,” a third source exclusively revealed in the new issue of <i>Us Weekly</i>. “She’ll go to trial before being separated from her family and take those odds rather than just go to prison as part of a deal.”</p><p>Scroll down to find out more about Guthy, the man Olivia is leaning on as her parents’ legal battle plays out.</p><p><strong>1. He is a singer-songwriter.</strong><br>Guthy, who is currently in the band North of Nine, started playing the piano as a 4-year-old and took up songwriting just three years later. “I got started at a really young age,” he told <a href=#><i>Seventeen </i></a>in March 2012, just one year after performing his single “Loving” on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>2. He’s a dog person.</strong><br>The “Young & Single” crooner loves<a href=#> spending time with his furry friends</a> and he has shared many <a href=#>pawesome photos cuddling with dogs</a> on his Instagram account.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>3. He isn’t afraid of PDA.</strong><br>Guthy didn’t mind when Olivia left a sweet comment on his March 5 Instagram collage. “Good looks,” she wrote alongside two black-and-white photos of the pop star lounging in his car. Guthy also knows how to manage a high-profile relationship because of his famous friendships with the likes of <strong>Noah Centineo</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Spencer Pratt</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>4. He has famous parents too.</strong><br>Like his girlfriend, Guthy understands the struggles of growing up in the spotlight. His mother, <strong>Victoria Jackson</strong>, ran a successful self-titled makeup company for years, while his father, <strong>Bill Guthy</strong>, leads a marketing firm Guthy-Renker, which is valued at $1.5 billion.</p><p><strong>5. He knows how to balance his personal and professional life.</strong><br>Guthy told <i>Seventeen </i>in March 2012 that he established a routine while touring with Big Time Rush and One Direction. “It was a really cool being out on the road and doing school with my tutor over Skype or on the phone, but it can definitely be difficult,” he admitted at the time. “My education is the most important thing, so I always have to make time for it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZuZaSdtq%2Bz0marqGWbo7y4ecCbpq6sXaS5qsLImmSjmZSawG6uzrKdq6GVo7FutsCcoqynnmK0tsDHsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
