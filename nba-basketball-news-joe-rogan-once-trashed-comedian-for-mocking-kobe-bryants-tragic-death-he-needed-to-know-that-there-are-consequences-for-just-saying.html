In particular, NBA fans might not find them funny.</span></p><p><span>Several years ago, Joe Rogan discussed provocative comic, Ari Shaffir, on his podcast.</span><span> He mentioned how comedians like Shaffir use dark humor to make their audience laugh by referring to tragic events.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 2020, the world was shocked when Kobe Bryant died.</span><span> As a joke, Shaffir made a tweet about the death of the legendary player. </span><span>According to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>him,</a>&nbsp;</span><span>“Kobe Bryant died 23 years too late today. He got away with r*pe because all the Hollywood liberals who attack comedy enjoy rooting for the Lakers more than they dislike rape. Big ups to the hero who forgot to gas up his chopper. I hate the Lakers. What a great day!” [h/t <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>popculture.com</a>]</span></p><p>Rogan sat down with Jim Norton and discussed Ari Shaffir’s joke that had drawn a lot of fire from the general public.

Joe Rogan also looked down on the comments and seemingly expected better from his comic friend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210306120750/GettyImages-855025056.jpg><p><span>“He needed to know that there are consequences for just saying ridiculous s— that you’re not supposed to say</span> <span>when people die,</span><span>” Rogan stated.</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nba-basketball-news-former-nba-player-jay-williams-issues-startling-ultimatum-to-james-harden-ahead-of-philadelphia-76ers-stint?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-02-02T035742Z_237633874_MT1USATODAY17602370_RTRMADP_3_NBA-BROOKLYN-NETS-AT-PHOENIX-SUNS-252x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Former NBA Player Issues Startling Ultimatum to James Harden Ahead of 76ers Stint</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Ari Shaffir about Kobe Bryant’s death</strong></h2><p><span>Shaffir has not been shy about making jokes about tragic events. His previous jokes have been about celebrities who passed away. These jokes were said as part of a meta-commentary about “too soon” jokes. This joke focuses on not being too serious about things.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-02-02T035742Z_237633874_MT1USATODAY17602370_RTRMADP_3_NBA-BROOKLYN-NETS-AT-PHOENIX-SUNS-252x315.jpg><p><span>Those who follow Shaffir’s know how he jokes around about these events on a regular basis. As for Rogan, Shaffir needs to be careful when making jokes about some people, especially if it is Bryant. As he said in the podcast</span></p><p><span>“When you do outrageous things to get people to be like ‘Oh, look at Jimmy, he’s crazy,’ you get caught in a trap and you keep doing it more and more outrageous.” [h/t <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>popculture.com</a>]</span></p><p><span>Shaffir’s tweet on social media contained a selfie video. According to the tweet, he seems to be happy with the death of the legendary player. As a result of the threats he received in relation to his jokes, he had to cancel many of his shows. In addition, he apologized on Instagram for whatever statement he made. How do you feel about this type of humor?
