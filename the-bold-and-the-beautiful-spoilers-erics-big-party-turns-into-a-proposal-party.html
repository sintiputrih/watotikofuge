He has his family, friends, and loved ones surrounding him at home now rather than at the hospital and he is ready to celebrate a whole new beginning.</p><p>He nearly died and crossed over to the other side where he felt peace, but he was not done living yet and felt compelled to return. Now, he is quickly on the mend and feeling better every day so he picks up where he left off with another grand party that turns into something more.</p><p>Eric shocks all when he proposes to Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis). Perhaps he was inspired by proposal-happy Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson).</p><p><img alt="The Bold and The Beautiful: Eric Forrester (John McCook)" width=730 height=522 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/02/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-spoilers-erics-big-party-turns-into-a-proposal-party/ data-jpibfi-post-title="The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: Eric’s Big Party Turns Into A Proposal Party" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BB-Eric-Forrester.jpeg></p><p><a href=#>All Eric knows for sure is that he is in love with her</a> and wants to spend the rest of his life with her and another try at marriage is the next logical step.</p><p>Donna has been there with Eric through his entire health crisis and has been his rock. There is nothing he wants more than to marry her again.</p><h3>RJ And Zende Make Peace…For Now</h3><p><a href=#>Seeing how happy their grandfather is prompts</a> RJ Forrester (Joshua Hoffman) and Zende Forrester (Delon De Metz) to make peace for the day. They don’t want their own feud to get in the way of Eric’s and Donna’s happiness, but the animosity between them is just bubbling beneath the surface.</p><p>Zende can’t stand watching RJ get everything just because he is Brooke Logan’s (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Ridge Forrester’s (Thorsten Kaye) “golden child” but RJ can’t stand seeing how Zende is jealous all the time. He also hates that Zende seems to be after Luna Nozawa (Lisa Yamada).</p><p>While they make a promise to spend a few hours not arguing, it is going to be hard for these two young men as they both can’t take their eyes off of the beautiful Luna. Will she be the one who has to referee another argument between them?</p><p>Tune into <a href=# rel=noopener>The Bold and the Beautiful weekdays on CBS to see how these</a> stories play out.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX91e49rZq2glWKvsLjDZpinnF2ptaZ5wZ6YrqyZm8KtedKppqKklafAbrHRopqsZZKetG68wKursmWkqr%2Bvv4yipa2nXZZ6sb7OqaasmZxivaK%2B07Jm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
