I played football and ran track, so I had double duty. Within my small town, I’m only one of two that has ever played football in the SEC… I wanted something different, so I just Googled ‘What profession can I make what I’m worth?’ and real estate popped up. I didn’t have a clue about real estate, but fast forward two or three years later, I was the number two agent in the U.S.”</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Given his success in the real world — as well as his adventurous nature, admitting that he enjoys fishing, riding four-wheelers, riding jet skis, and more in his official biography for Survivor 46 — we cannot help but assume that he will also have success on Survivor, but fans of the franchise have just one burning question: Is Q knowledgable enough about the game itself?</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>Given his Survivor hot take — as well as his reasoning, which he explained to reporter Mike Bloom in an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a> — signs point to yes.

Carolyn had idols. She didn’t share information when she could have. I think she was in control of her emotions. Although it might seem like she wasn’t, she knew exactly what she was doing, and her game was just, to me, just overall better than Yam Yam’s game and Heidi’s combined, if you had to combine those two.
