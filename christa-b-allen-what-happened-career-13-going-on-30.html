For example, there are obvious advantages like earning a sizable and regular salary as well as enjoying the fruits of fame. On top of that, starring in a show for years results in an actor accumulating a slew of fans who come to care deeply about them for as long as the series runs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, once a show ends after years on the air, the series’ stars sometimes fade out of the spotlight. As a result, fans find themselves wondering <a href=#>where the stars of their favorite shows like One Tree Hill are now</a>. Similarly, now that series' finale aired more than seven years ago, some of the show’s fans don’t know <a href=#>what Revenge's lead actor Emily Van Camp is up to now</a>. With that in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that some Revenge fans don’t know what has happened to one of the show’s other stars, Christa B. Allen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'The O.C': Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><h2 id=christa-b-allen-rsquo-s-career-has-been-defined-by-these-projects>Christa B. Allen’s Career Has Been Defined By These Projects</h2><p>Throughout Hollywood history, there have been countless movies released and quickly forgotten. On the other hand, there have also been lots of films that people came to care deeply about even though most people would have predicted that they wouldn’t make much of an impact. For example, when 13 Going on 30 was released in 2004, the movie garnered a sizable fan following that was charmed by how fun and heartwarming the film was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, most people associate 13 Going on 30 with its stars like Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo, Judy Greer, and Andy Serkis. Additionally, even though most fans couldn’t identify them by name, the actors who played the teen versions of the main characters also made their mark on audiences. That is a great thing for Christa B Allen as she was the actor who was tapped to play the young version of the film’s main character Jenna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years after Christa B. Allen made her film debut in 13 Going on 30, she landed one of the starring roles in the hit ABC drama Revenge. As one of the show’s stars who headlined all four of Revenge’s seasons, it is very safe to say that fans of the show remember Allen’s portrayal of Charlotte Grayson fondly. For that reason, when it was learned that she wasn’t going to be included in a reunion show and that <a href=#>Allen claimed to have been bullied on Revenge’s set</a>, fans were outraged.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ariana Grande Dressed Up Like This ‘13 Going On 30’ Character For ‘The Voice’</a></span></p><h2 id=christa-b-allen-rsquo-s-post-revenge-life>Christa B. Allen’s Post-Revenge Life</h2><p>In the years since Revenge came to an end in 2015, many fans of the show have kept Christa B. Allen in their lives in the form of binge-watching the series repeatedly. However, if they wanted to see the talented actor in another role, Allen has given them some chances since she has popped up in more than one show and movie. For example, Allen popped up in an episode of Code Black and an episode of Babby Daddy she played a role in aired soon after Revenge’s finale. However, it is unknown whether or not Allen filmed that episode of Baby Daddy before or after her revenge filming schedule wrapped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Christa B. Allen’s acting career hasn’t been on fire in recent years, that doesn’t mean that she has rested on her laurels by any means. Instead, Allen has taken her career in some new directions that have been cool for fans of her work to see. For example, Allen and someone named Johnny What formed a musical group called Pour Vous, and in 2018, they released a single titled “Scorpio”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Actors Who Are Surprisingly Good Musicians</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Christa B. Allen released her music, that didn’t get that much attention which makes sense. After all, there are millions of extremely talented musicians who release songs each year and it sadly is far too easy for a lot of music to fly under the radar. However, Allen has one big thing going for her, her Hollywood history. As a result, when Allen created social media accounts including a Tik Tok account, lots of longtime fans of hers showed up. In fact, as of the time of this writing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allen has more than 1.8 million followers on Tik Tok</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The main reason why Christa B. Allen has so many followers on Tik Tok is that she seems to have a better understanding of the app than almost all of her Hollywood peers. For example, she seems to understand that going viral is the thing that really launches a social media account. After all, Allen has posted several videos that were designed to garner attention including ones in which very little is left to the imagination. On top of that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allen’s most talked-about post has to be a video in which she revisited her 13 Going On 30 character</a> by dressing up in an outfit Jennifer Garner wore in the film. Of course, the fact that Allen is now old enough to play Garner’s version of the character they both played in the popular film is part of the reason why her video went viral.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Can Fans Actually Buy The '13 Going On 30' Dress That Jennifer Garner Wore?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGiecFmmKWklaN6uLTArWShmaClsq%2Bxw2aamqqVmr9ufZJmnqihnpx6sLqMbGdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
