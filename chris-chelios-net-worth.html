Chelios is a three-time Stanley Cup winner (one with Montreal and two with Detroit), is a Hall of Fame inductee as of 2013, and won the gold medal at the World Cup of Hockey, representing the USA in 1996. His career started in 1984 and ended in 2010.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Chris Chelios is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Chelios’ net worth is as high as $20 million, an amount earned largely through his successful career as a pro hockey player. In addition to playing hockey in the NHL, Chelios also owns a chain of restaurants, which has improved his wealth too.</p><h3>Chris Chelios Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Chris Chelios was born into a Greek family and grew up in Illinois, where he went to the Mount Carmel High School before his father moved his business to the San Diego area. Chris continued his education at the Mira Mesa High School, and then played hockey for the Moose Jaw Canucks of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, before the Montreal Canadiens selected him in the 1981 Entry Draft.</p><p>Chelios later played for the Wisconsin Badgers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and won the NCAA Men’s Ice Hockey Championship with them, while in 1984 he represented the US at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. In the 1984-85 season, Chelios scored 64 points in 74 games for Montreal, earning an invitation to the All-Star game, and was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. In the next season, Chris played in 41 matches, and won his first Stanley Cup, while in 1988-89, he had a breakout season with 73 points in 80 games, entered the All-Star First Team and won the James Norris Memorial Trophy. All these achievements were potentially beneficial to his net worth.</p><p>In June 1990, Chelios was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for Denis Savard, and in 1992 he helped the Blackhawks to reach the Stanley Cup Final, but the Pittsburgh Penguins swept them in four games. The next season, Chris scored 73 points and won another James Norris Memorial Trophy, then in the truncated 1994-95 season, he represented the EHC Biel in the Swiss National League A, during the NHL lockout. In 1995-96, Chelios scored 72 points and won his third Norris Trophy, and he also led the US team to the gold medal at 1996 World Cup of Hockey, when they defeated Canada in the final. For the rest of his career with the Blackhawks, Chelios served as their captain until 1999, when he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in March.</p><p>Chris played a significant role in his first couple of seasons with the Red Wings, while in 2002, he won his second Stanley Cup when Detroit defeated the Carolina Hurricanes. He made it to the All-Star game, and led his national side to the silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics. After playing a few more seasons in Motown and captaining the unsuccessful US team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Chelios won his third Stanley Cup in 2008, becoming the oldest active player to do so. Following his farewell with the Red Wings, Chris spent his last playing days with the Atlanta Thrashers before announced his retirement in August 2010.</p><p>However, Chelios didn’t want to say goodbye to hockey, so he was named the Adviser to Hockey Operations for the Red Wings, while in June 2015, Chris worked as an assistant coach for Team USA at the 2016 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.</p><p>Aside from hockey, Chris also owns three restaurants; in Dearborn, Detroit, and Clinton Township, Michigan, and the one in Detroit was a murder scene when the 17-year-old Justin Blackshere stabbed two employees: Megan Soroka and Mark Bernard.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Chris Chelios has been married Tracee since 1987, and they have four children together. Chelios currently resides in Detroit, Michigan, but also owns a mansion in Malibu, California.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.9009009009009><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Chris Chelios</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 25, 1962</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Evergreen Park, Illinois USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 1" (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>87 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Ice hockey defenseman</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>University of Wisconsin-Madison</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Tracee Chelios</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Jake Chelios, Dean Chelios, Tara Chelios, Caley Chelios</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Constantine Chelios</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Steve Chelios</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155058/</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>James Norris Memorial Trophy, Mark Messier Leadership Award, NHL Plus-Minus Award</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>Calder Memorial Trophy, Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=39.381130507066><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.2727272727273><td>1</td><td>Former teammate of <a href=#>Aaron Downey</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Announced retirement.
