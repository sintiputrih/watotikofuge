It’s probably been a bit of an ongoing journey in your life. As we age and both our bodies and preferences change, the pillows we once loved suddenly start to feel uncomfortable, hot, too firm or too soft. Sometimes we keep sleeping on them for a while anyway. We already have a perfectly fine pillow, so why switch? (Even if we are in pain.)</p><p>No more of that. This is your sign to buy that new pillow. If there is one amazing thing you can do for yourself that may benefit you literally every single night, it’s buying a pillow that specifically works for you — one that will last! Maybe you need one made of cooling materials like bamboo, or perhaps a fluffy down one. Maybe you need one that will help with neck pain, or one specifically made for side or stomach sleepers. A comfortable, refreshing night’s sleep can affect your entire day — and even things like <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> and skin health. So let’s do this! We’ve already done the research for you, so all you have to do is pick. We have options from $23 to $139!</p><h3><strong>3 Quick Picks:</strong></h3><p>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 28, 2021, but are subject to change.</p><h3>How to Choose a Pillow — 5 Things to Consider</h3><ul><li>The way you sleep. Side sleepers, back sleepers and stomach sleepers may all prefer different types of pillows.</li><li>The firmness of the pillow. Don’t judge a pillow by its cover. It might look ultra-fluffy but actually be hard as a dense rock!</li><li>Your breathing. If you deal with allergies, acid reflux or even snoring, buying a wedge pillow could be a major help.</li><li>Your mattress. A pillow and a mattress go hand in hand. If you have a memory foam mattress you sink into, you might want a thinner pillow so you don’t strain your neck.</li><li>Temperature. If you’re a hot sleeper, for example, the filling of your pillow could make a big difference so you won’t have to flip it over the other side every 10 minutes!</li></ul><h3>10 of the Best Pillows on Amazon</h3><h4>Best overall pillow: Leesa Standard Size Cooling Foam Pillow for Sleeping</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-pillows-amazon-leesa.jpg><p>Not too soft, not too firm, this Leesa pillow was made to provide the perfect support for any type of sleeper.
