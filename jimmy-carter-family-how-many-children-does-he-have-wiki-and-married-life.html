Her appearance was significant, highlighting the Carter presidency’s emphasis on family.</p><h2>Investigating Jimmy Carter’s Sons</h2><p><strong>John William “Jack” Carter:</strong> Jack, the oldest, has dabbled in politics and business. With two children from his previous marriage, Jack’s life is more private than Amy’s.</p><p><strong>James Earl “Chip” III Carter:</strong> Chip is the father of two children, James Earl IV and Margaret Alicia.
