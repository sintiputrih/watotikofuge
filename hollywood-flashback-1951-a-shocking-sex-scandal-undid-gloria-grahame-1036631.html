Grahame’s specialty was the film noir femme fatale. Unfortunately, she also made some fatal career moves.</p><p>In June 1951, Ray caught her in bed at their Malibu home with Tony, his 13-year-old son from his first marriage who’d just returned from military school. “It was the kind of thing Gloria Grahame the actress would have done in her movies,” says biopic director Paul <span data-scayt_word=McGuigan data-scaytid=6>McGuigan</span>. The gossip tsunami the tryst generated would only be exceeded nine years later when Grahame married Tony; she had two children with him and the most peaceful 14 years of any of her four marriages. (The union made Tony the stepfather to his half brother Timothy, the child Ray had fathered with Grahame.)</p><p>Her credits after 1960 are primarily in television and British theater. Grahame was 57 when she died in New York in 1981 from cancer and peritonitis, just hours after returning from London. “Gloria is different from other stars of that era; she doesn’t live on in people’s minds,” says <span data-scayt_word=Bening data-scaytid=7>Bening</span>. “There are so many forgotten stories. Gloria represents that for me.”</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Annie/unnamed.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>This story first appeared in The Hollywood Reporter’s Sept. 8 daily issue at the Toronto Film Festival.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKm7y6WwsKefmXqnuMCsn5uZk6B6coWUamSaZaOdvKS3yKeeZquVrXq0r8Cnm5qkXaq7pbXDZp6lp6Kerm6z0ZqfmqWVYn5xf5Vvampn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
