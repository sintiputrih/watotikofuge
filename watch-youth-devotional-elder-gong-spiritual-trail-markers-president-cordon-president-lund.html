Gong</a> of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles assured youth that wherever they are, the Lord gives them spiritual trail markers to manifest His love and guide their path.&nbsp;</p><p>“Please look with eyes to see,” the Apostle invited. “You’ll find spiritual trail markers in many places — friends and families, quorums and classes, bishops and other leaders, patriarchal blessings, scriptures, activities and service, the holy house of the Lord, and especially the promptings of the Holy Ghost that draw us to our Savior Jesus Christ.”</p><p>Recognizing and following spiritual trail markers that lead to the Savior was the focus of the event titled “I Can Do All Things Through Christ,” based on the <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>2023 youth theme</a> in <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Philippians 4:13</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Prerecorded with <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>a live audience in the Conference Center</a>, the devotional featured participation from Young Women General <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>President Bonnie H. Cordon</a>, Young Men General <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>President Steven J. Lund</a> and eight youth hosts.</p><p>To help illustrate the theme of spiritual trail markers, the devotional included video segments of the youth and Church leaders hiking Ensign Peak in the foothills of Salt Lake City.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3bb4ca4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/730x487!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FB6rNGVLC9sqj2ROqU-eCjKugbhA%3D%2F0x0%3A6000x4000%2F6000x4000%2Ffilters%3Afocal%283000x2000%3A3001x2001%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24388673%2F5f5a43b5775511ed9c3feeeeac1e5573bf48acb1__1_.jpeg"><p>President Lund taught that like the small mounds of stones placed along trails to help others find their way, the Lord gives spiritual trail markers that can confirm progress or warn of danger ahead. “Our task is to just move our feet one step at a time, to take each step forward and then the next,” he said.</p><p>“No matter how steep the climb or hard the journey,” President Cordon said, “we are not alone. We can draw strength from the Savior.”</p><h2>‘Our most important trail markers’</h2><p>During unscripted discussions on the hike and on stage, several of the youth hosts opened up about personal hardships and how they have found strength in the Savior.&nbsp;</p><p>“My father passed away when I was in eighth grade, and that was definitely hard,” said 17-year-old Ammon Downs. “Now that it’s been a few years, and I’ve really opened up, I can see the blessings that I’ve received. And I still sometimes feel alone. But if I just pray about it and come closer to God, I feel like Heavenly Father is with me and so is my dad.”</p><p>Joey Reynoso, 14, said he struggled with a speech impediment until a few years ago. “Hardly anyone understood me. It was so hard. ... After years of hard work, prayer, fasting and help from my parents, I finally overcame my trial. I have a strong testimony that through Christ, our Lord, we can truly do anything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4b6711b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2200x1467+0+0/resize/730x487!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FlXTZjgeX0QfXnrXN6e_blJOo9cI%3D%2F0x0%3A2200x1467%2F2200x1467%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281100x734%3A1101x735%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24388681%2FPresident_Lund.jpg"><p>After Joey shared his experience, 16-year-old Hannah Lamoreaux commented: “That’s why I love this new theme. I love this whole idea of ‘We can do all things through Christ.’ I know that Heavenly Father is always there, wanting us to come to Him. He’s always standing there with open arms. But all it takes is us going to Him.”</p><p>Joseph Andelin II testified that with the Savior’s help, “we’re able to become so much better, and we’re able to move past anything.” The 16-year-old also admitted that sometimes he struggles&nbsp;to get to the point of wanting to go to the Savior when he is going through hard things. He asked the Church leaders what they do to help themselves have the desire to come unto Christ.</p><p>President Cordon said she treasures prayer and the opportunity to be still. President Lund said everyday he reads the scriptures until he feels a connection with heaven.</p><p>Elder Gong said it helps him to know that choices have consequences. “Jesus Christ will help us when we need to change or repent, when we sin or make mistakes, which we all do. Our Savior and His Atonement are our most important trail markers, our greatest source of strength as we make our way through life,” he said.</p><h2>FSY guide and FSY conferences</h2><p>The youth also discussed the new principle-based <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>“For the Strength of Youth” guide</a> and <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>For the Strength of Youth conferences</a>, which began in the United States and Canada in 2022.</p><p>Natali Gallardo, 17, had the opportunity to attend an FSY conference last summer — what she described as “one of the best experiences of my life.” She attended a class on repentance that “completely changed my view,” she said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/74f9f96/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2200x1466+0+0/resize/730x486!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FKbvQaM7ZI50-rkr5lZtE9Zgu1ZM%3D%2F0x0%3A2200x1466%2F2200x1466%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281100x733%3A1101x734%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24388543%2F20230120_173020_CBell_CMB_2951.JPG"><p>When the new “For the Strength of Youth” guide was announced, 17-year-old Emily Brown said she was hesitant and nervous for the change “because there wasn’t a clear-cut yes-or-no answer on some things.”</p><p>“I like to be a rule follower, and that was a big adjustment for me,” she said. “But since reading it over, I have gotten the impression that we have this new guide because the Lord trusts us. And Heavenly Father knows that we can make good, righteous decisions, and He’s giving us the opportunity to do so.”</p><p>Emily added: “I also think it’s important that we still counsel with parents and leaders about the questions that we may be facing and to also consult general conference talks. Because there’s not clear yes-or-no answers in the guide, you can find good answers to your questions through the words of the prophets.”</p><p>The guide represents a “higher and holier way” — a deeper relationship with the Savior, President Lund said.</p><p>Of developing this relationship, 17-year-old Bryson Ripley said: “No matter what, we’re going to go through hard things. No matter what, we’re going to have trials ... . I would a thousand times rather have God on my side when I’m going through these hardships.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c9699a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2200x1466+0+0/resize/730x486!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2F4J8Bj6F709c8HlQOmrJlJC6wVcw%3D%2F0x0%3A2200x1466%2F2200x1466%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281100x733%3A1101x734%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24388546%2F20230120_175422_CBell_CMB_4485.JPG"><h2>#AllThingsThrough Christ</h2><p>At the top of Ensign Peak with Elder Gong and the other youth, 15-year-old Teji Nelson shared why the hiking experience will be memorable for her: “When we’re struggling in life and we don’t understand why certain things are happening, this can remind us that there’s always a bigger picture.”</p><p>In her concluding remarks, President Cordon invited youth to share their experiences and testimonies on social media throughout the year using #AllThingsThrough Christ.</p><p>President Cordon also encouraged youth not to underestimate the power of the 10 simple words in <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Philippians 4:13</a>. “While the first five words are aspirational — ‘I can do all things’ — it truly is those last five words that will bring power, purpose and peace in our lives — ‘through Christ which strengtheneth me.’&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d94a507/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2200x1466+0+0/resize/730x486!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FQUhzp1BzYXpfyatOVPKVXw6o-rw%3D%2F0x0%3A2200x1466%2F2200x1466%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281100x733%3A1101x734%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24388656%2F20230122_191751_CBell_CMB_2260.JPG"><p>“It’s only when we combine our effort with the Lord’s strength that we will discover the ability to move forward in all things. … My dear friends, the more you seek Him, the more you will see Him and the many spiritual markers that surround you.”&nbsp;</p><p>President Lund added: “I share with you my personal witness that because He loves us — because He loves us so much — we can do all things through Christ. So let’s love Him in return by following Him and by following His spiritual trail markers which He places along our way.”</p><p>Elder Gong thanked the youth for listening to and including one another and for living the gospel and following Jesus Christ even when it is not easy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/734d360/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2200x1466+0+0/resize/730x486!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fw3boDzt_mZCDB1-hsd3KxQ5GJFQ%3D%2F0x0%3A2200x1466%2F2200x1466%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281100x733%3A1101x734%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24388664%2F20230120_170854_CBell_CMB_2325.JPG"><p>To those who may sometimes feel inadequate or unworthy, “there’s always a place for you in the Lord’s Church,” Elder Gong lovingly reassured. “There’s always room for you in His inn.</p><p>“Dear young friends, God lives. He always loves you. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. Because of His Atonement, there is no point of no return. His light is always on, His arms are always open to welcome and embrace us. …</p><p>“The Book of Mormon, the ordinances and covenants of the house of the Lord, the testimonies of the prophets and apostles, and especially the Holy Ghost — these precious spiritual trail markers point us to our Savior Jesus Christ, whose witness I am and of whom I solemnly testify.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/299d385/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2200x1466+0+0/resize/730x486!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2F3-ATRvZvhO9-mHCavOsQQ2YRJco%3D%2F0x0%3A2200x1466%2F2200x1466%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281100x733%3A1101x734%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24388552%2F20230122_200725_CBell_CMB_3688.JPG"><p>The Church’s next worldwide youth event will be a music and arts festival in August.
