At the time, Tendler acknowledged Mulaney’s battle with drμg and alc0hol addiction in a statement.</p><p>“I am heartbroken that John has decided to end our marriage, I wish him support and success as he continues his recovery.”</p><p><strong>Five months after the comedian first filed, the couple officially ended their six-year marriage on Thursday, January 6, 2022 <a href=# rel=noopener>according to documents obtained by TMZ</a>.</strong> Prior to being hitched in July 2014 in the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York, the pair initially met in 2010.</p><p>After spending time in rehab for alc0holism and cocἀine addiction, a Mulaney spokesperson confirmed the separation in May 2021. In her own statement, Tendler added:</p><p>“John will not have any further comment as he continues to focus on his recovery and getting back to work. I am heartbroken that John has decided to end our marriage. I wish him support and success as he continues his recovery.”</p><p>The actress Olivia Munn, who formerly referred to herself as Mulaney’s “obsessed” fan was revealed to be in a relationship with the comedian a week after their divorce was made public. Munn’s pregnancy with her first child with Mulaney was confirmed less than two months later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/John-Mulaney-With-Anna-Marie-Tendler-.jpg><p>Mulaney’s relationship with actress Olivia Munn was first reported shortly after the divorce announcement. In September 2021, he announced that he and Munn were expecting a child. He mentioned it during <a href=# rel=noopener>Seth Meyers’ Late Night</a>.</p><p>“I packed a lot into this year, I went to rehab in September, I got out in October, I moved out of my home from my ex-wife. Then in the spring I went to Los Angeles and met and started to date a wonderful woman named Olivia and we’re having a baby together. I was nervous when I was about to say the news! Olivia and this baby have helped save me from myself in this early journey out of recovery.”</p><p>Despite being “heartbroken” by the breakup, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tendler said in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar</a> that she has had time to reflect and process and is now eager to begin a new chapter in her life. She explained:</p><p>“I feel lucky that I get to be standing on the precipice of all of these new things, that I get to possibly experience, and who knows how they will go? And there is certainly something exciting about that.”</p><p><strong>You can also take a&nbsp; look&nbsp; at other celebrities’ divorce details we have provided below links:</strong></p><p>You can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> and read all of our most recent posts to stay up to date on additional information about other celebrities’ personal lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdganxxf46jpqGmXaLCra3NnrBmnJmrvLOvxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
