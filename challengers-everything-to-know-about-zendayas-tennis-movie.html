Although their teenage flirtation gets a little messy, it’s not until they’re all adults that their complex relationships are fully realized.</p><p>When Art and Patrick face off in a “Challenger” match — which is close to the lowest level of pro tournament — as grown men, they find themselves once again butting heads over Tashi. This time, however, Art is married to Tashi and Patrick is no longer part of their friendship group.</p><p>“She’s wonderful,” Guadagnino told <a href=#>Variety</a> of Zendaya in October 2022, four months after filming wrapped. “I mean, wow. We edited the movie, and we almost actually don’t use any of her double. She’s so good.”</p><p>In June, <a href=#>MGM released the official trailer for Challengers</a>, describing the movie <a href=#>via social media</a> as a display of “the art of seduction and other games.”</p><p></p><p>In the clip, Tashi (Zendaya) starts off as the one to watch on the tennis court due to her skills. Her confidence as a player pours over to her personal life as both Art (Faist) and Patrick (O’Connor) <a href=#>quickly fall under her spell</a>. “Aren’t you everybody’s type?” Art asks in the video, before both he and Patrick hookup with Tashi.</p><p>While Art later claims that Patrick is “not in love” with Tashi, she still picks Patrick as her teenage boyfriend. “What makes you think I want someone to be in love with me?” she quips.</p><p>Fast forward a few years and Patrick falls out of her life, while Art and Tashi grow closer. As adults, Tashi becomes a coach, leading Art to become a champion — but their past with Patrick isn’t behind them.</p><p>“I think maybe you’re disturbed by the fact that she could have been into someone like me,” Patrick teases after learning that he and Art will compete against each other.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tashi, for her part, appears to be enjoying the show as both men vie for her attention and the title of tennis champion.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about <a href=#>Zendaya’s Challengers</a>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BYtaK4y56loJ2iqHqmwsSrsK2gmaO0bsDOZqKnp6dirqO71K1ks52ema66rdJmq56mnp7AbrnOr6CeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
