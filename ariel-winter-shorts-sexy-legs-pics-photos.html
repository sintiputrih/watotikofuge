From different-colored denim to floral patterns, she’s pulled off a wide variety of short looks that accentuate her toned legs and we can’t get enough! With her beauty and charm, she definitely knows how to turn heads and make headlines while doing so. Let’s check out some of our favorite times Ariel wore short shorts and completely owned every bit of it!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ariel truly rocked it in black denim shorts with a cropped white tee that showed off major cleavage in one pic and she chose white denim shorts with a gray crop top in another. She also wore her white denim shorts with a matching white tank top for a different outing. Who could forget her silky short shorts with a floral pattern? They featured red and yellow flowers and looked great on her with a white turtle neck crop top.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The brunette beauty also stepped out in blue and white striped shorts that were reminiscent of pajama shorts! She owned those too while choosing to wear a matching white cropped tank. Ariel went casual when she went for a stroll and wore black short shorts with a matching black tee and a blue and white plaid button down shirt wrapped around her waist. Finally, her really short black denim shorts showed off some major thigh action when she posed with boyfriend <strong>Levi Meaden</strong>, 30, at the Knotts Scary Farm Celebrity Night Buena Park back in Sept. 2017. In addition to the shorts, she chose a black baggy long-sleeved top for the night.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>So many amazing looks!
