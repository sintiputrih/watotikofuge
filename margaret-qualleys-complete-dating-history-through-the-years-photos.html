While <a href=#><strong>Margaret Qualley</strong></a> has made a name for herself as an accomplished actress, <a href=#>her dating history also made headlines</a> through the years.</p><p class=p4>“I’ve always dreamt of getting married. There’s a girly-girl part of me that’s thought about what my wedding would be like,” the&nbsp;<i>Maid&nbsp;</i>star confessed to&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a>&nbsp;</i>in September 2021. “And <a href=#>I’ve dreamt of having kids</a>. I’m a real romantic in that way.”</p><p class=p4>While Qualley — who’s the daughter of <a href=#><strong>Andie MacDowell</strong> </a>and <strong>Paul Qualley</strong> — has seldom addressed her romantic relationships, she has been linked to <a href=#><strong>Nat Wolff</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Shia LaBeouf</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> and more.</p><p class=p4><i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i><a href=#>broke the news in August 2019</a> that she was dating the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>&nbsp;</i>star, with a source noting that “they’ve&nbsp;been seeing each other for a couple of months and Margaret is really excited about him.”</p><p class=p4>Later that month, the <a href=#>former couple made their public debut</a> at the Venice Film Festival premiere of her film&nbsp;<i>Seberg</i>.</p><p class=p4>“Pete and Margaret were standing and chatting [and] laughing,” <a href=#>an eyewitness told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;at the time</a>. “There wasn’t much PDA, but he was in a good mood and the two of them were joking around. Margaret walked to the other side [of baggage claim] to get her bag and Pete was waiting with an older lady. Pete was super nice and posed for a photo.”</p><p class=p4>After a whirlwind romance,&nbsp;<i>Us </i><a href=# rel>exclusively revealed in October 2019</a> that the pair had gone their separate ways but remained friends. The&nbsp;<i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&nbsp;</i>actress subsequently <a href=#>spent quality time with her mother</a> in the wake of the split.</p><p class=p4>“We do a lot of yoga! And we hike, we have great, deep conversations,” MacDowell <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that October</a>, refusing to further comment on the breakup, which she called “thoughtless, on my part.”</p><p class=p4>The&nbsp;<i>Native Son&nbsp;</i>actress eventually moved on with the likes of director <strong>Cary Fukunaga</strong>, the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Even Stevens</a>&nbsp;</i>alum and <a href=#><strong>Jack Antonoff</strong></a>.&nbsp;Margaret and the music producer were <a href=#>photographed packing on the PDA in August 2021</a> and the couple have been spotted together several times since. The pair took their low-key romance public in March 2022, <a href=#>attending the Critics’ Choice Awards together</a> when <a href=#>the actress was nominated for her role on Netflix’s&nbsp;<i>Maid</i></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p4>While the former ballerina and the musician have yet to publicly address their relationship status, the pair posed for photos inside the Century Plaza Hotel, where the awards show was held.
