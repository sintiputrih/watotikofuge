Because it <u>definitely</u> used a move this time, I'm sure of it.<p>I mean, <i>this <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/attachments/1706894732887-png.182460/ data-url data-zoom-target=1 alt=1706894732887.png title=1706894732887.png width=267 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> </i>looks like a move to me, and if I had to guess I'd say that's Heal Pulse, based on the glow and the fact it healed the Maushold with it.</p><p>But besides that? Pretty big yawner for me. Not much action or really much of anything going on besides the Maushold rescue. And yay, now the Maushold's living on the Brave Olivine with the rest of the RVTs. That's.........great, I guess? Except my only problem with that, and with all the Pokemon living on the ship, is they just feel kinda.......<i>there</i>? Like, they don't really do much of anything, and I forget they exist half the time. And now Maushold's just gonna be another one.<br></p><p>You know I kinda gotta wonder if the wild Pokémon joining the ship is the writers’ solution to the issue of Goh’s captures from Journeys. This way, the ship gains a series of new Pokemon’l over the course of the series and none of the cast gets bogged down with a big number of pointless captures. Plus with them being around, it doesn’t take away the possibility of capture down the line.</p>However, kinda just like Goh's Pokémon, they just feel........there, like in the background, not doing anything memorable, and pretty much being forgettable. I guess it's better than giving them to someone like you said, but.......I'd rather they just not be there at all, or at least have someone catch them soon. I mean, look at that random Pawmi for example. It's a Gen 9 Pokémon, new and everything, <i>aaand</i>........it's completely and utterly forgettable. It just fades into the background, and it's been doing so for the entire series so far. Just saying.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHypxo9sb2arn6h6p77OpmSwmZugrq%2Bx2a6komZjZX11fpZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
