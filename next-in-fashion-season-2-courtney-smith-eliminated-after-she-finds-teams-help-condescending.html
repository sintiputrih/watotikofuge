Fans cannot be any more excited to see 12 talented and budding designers battle it out to be the next fashion icon in the industry. 'Queer eye' star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tan France</a> and supermodel Gigi Hadid have paired up to host the new season and we are in love with their quirky friendship.</p><p>One designer featured on the show is <a href=# rel>Courtney Smith</a>, who caters to plus-sized women with her creations. In the second episode of the new season, the designers had been divided into two teams and were given a "seriously technical" task of designing with real-life flowers and plants. The first team challenge of the season is here, but it looks like Courtney is not a team player, and that led to her ruin on '<a href=# rel>Next in Fashion</a>.'</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Next in Fashion' Season 1 winner Minju Kim is now designer for BTS and Red Velvet</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Next in Fashion': Who is Deontr√© Hancock?

She also wanted to add a long train of real vines to her design. Her team was concerned that Courntey's dress was taking up "a lot more time than it should." So they all pitched in to help her out. Nigel took over and started to cut the lining for the mini dress and Desyree got the sleeves ready.</p><p>But Courtney had a different opinion. She revealed that the vibe she was getting from the team was that they needed, "to pick up the slack." She was disappointed with this attitude and found it really "condescending."</p><h2 class=split>Courtney Smith's refusal to accept help got her eliminated</h2><p>Courtney decided that she could do it on her own and the team shouldn't feel the need to "pick up her slack." After they asked if she needed help with anything else for the 10th time, she blatantly refused and revealed, "she didn't need them to help her." She has been making it on her own in this industry and was confident she knew "what I am doing." But it seems like the judges weren't impressed by her creation.</p><p>Jason felt that the dress was too "basic." And others agreed with that, Tan commented that the dress should "blossom" without the flowers too. Jason said, "The actual shape of the dress is not something truly special." Tan shared he wished Courtney worked with Nigel on the flowers so that it showcased her "vision" too. In the end, they felt her work was too simple, as they said "it was just a dress, that's it," and waved goodbye to Courtney.</p><p>You can catch 'Next in Fashion' on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoppWtwW61zWadmquYnryvedKemKynnmJ%2Fbq%2FOrqmtppWuerS5yK2fZp2cnrqqusCtnJ1lkZvBpr6MrJ%2BeZZaeu6W%2FjK2cmqWjYrWmuM9mmqimlJrApLHNnaCnnw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
