Fox's religion?</h2><p>Michael J. Fox hasn't been known to be religious. In his 2009 memoir, titled Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist, he considered himself a lapsed Catholic. However, his marriage to former co-star <a href=#>Tracy Pollan</a> has gotten him involved with Reform Judaism. He and Tracy raised all four of <a href=#>their children</a> Jewish.</p><p>"It's fair to say I have staked a claim in Judaism," Michael <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in his memoir. "I've married a Jewish girl, and we are raising our children in the Jewish culture and, moreover, in the Jewish faith — our three oldest have been bar and bat mizvahed." He also said that he regularly attends a synagogue in Manhattan.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In December 2007, the former Spin City star was recognized by the Union for Reform Judaism for his work on behalf of Parkinson's disease research and stem cell research. Union President Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie praised Michael's efforts, stating it encapsulated "the highest ideals of Judaism," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Doors</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While accepting the award, Michael recalled a time when he was helping his twin daughters, Aquinnah and Schuyler, with their Torah homework. The trio then came across a section about David's fight with Goliath and how he refused a sword and armor for the battle.</p><p>He then made an analogy between that and the misinformation about stem cell research: "I think David understood something fundamental about the deepest ideals of repairing the world. The armor, the weapons, the swords, they're just a distraction — and distraction is not what wins the battle. You just need the truth."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2aiXZu8uXnRnqOin5mkuw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
