Tom succumbed to Alzheimer’s disease on October 19, 2023, after a valiant struggle. He had existed for an extended duration. Surviving him are his wife, Lisa Anne McElmurry, with whom he was married for 23 years, his son Thomas Shane McElmurry from Southfield, Michigan, his daughter Michelle Marie McElmurry Bock, and his son-in-law Daniel Frederick Bock from Rockford, Michigan.</p><p>For an indefinite period of time, his grandchildren, Taryn Marie Bock and Kaden Daniel Bock, will deeply respect their father. Furthermore, his extensive network of relatives by marriage and nephews, all of whom held him in high regard, will deeply feel his absence. Prior to his demise, both of his parents, Elvin and Carmen McElmurry, along with his sister Linda McElmurry Hill, had already deceased. Tom, a student at Adelphia Academy, obtained his diploma in 1972. He was born in Royal Oak, Michigan.</p><p>Right after obtaining his degree, Tom commenced his profession as a paramedic with Suburban Ambulance. Later on, he ultimately secured a job at Huron Valley Ambulance, situated in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Tom and Lisa, who initially met at the Huron Valley Ambulance, subsequently tied the knot. After residing in Whitmore Lake, Michigan, and Clinton, Michigan for twenty-three years, they relocated to Bluffton, South Carolina, and Ridgeland, South Carolina. Both of these sites are situated inside the state of Michigan.</p><p>Com and Lisa, being ardent animal enthusiasts, had a plethora of delightful dogs and cats throughout their relationship. Furthermore, they experienced numerous delightful occasions riding Tom’s beloved Harley Davidson motorcycle and socializing on the beach, relishing the warm rays of the sun. Tom was able to satisfy his passion for photography and bird watching while simultaneously furthering his fascination with the natural environment. The lack of Tom is expected to be strongly experienced.</p><p>Visitors to this memorial page are invited to offer their sympathies and share them with the relevant family members.&nbsp;A memorial service has been arranged at Sauls Funeral Home in Bluffton, South Carolina, on November 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM. Following the celebration, there will be a convocation of acquaintances and relatives in the Abbey Glen Clubhouse for the subsequent hours.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKWZmLWmuMueZKablaG6tr7YZqaboaSqrrPFjKWYpJ1dmLa1xYymoKemlai8ta2MpqCcoJWhuaZ5zJycpaWlp8ZusMSaq6FlmaOzsHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
