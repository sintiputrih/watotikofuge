Having never seen his sides play , I went into the interwebs looking for opinions on Bauza. First thing I see is his website. Nifty. I see opinions ranging from, “eh, he’s good, he got some Ecuadorian club to win CL” to “meh, his teams are like getting a a friggin root canal operation done” , to ” it’s like serving shit on a stick”.</p><p>But fear not, fellow albiceleste fans. If you think we have it bad, just look northward and eastwards. England goes out and hires Sam friggin Allerdyce. Have you seen him? No , have you really? Belgium, to save their golden generation, goes out and brings in Roberto martinez!! The same dude who has been living off an FA cup win with Wigan some years back! Brazil , as if one vasectomy operation was not enough, hired Dunga the 2nd time around. That’s how bad $hit gets at the national team level. It’s just politics and bs.</p><p>Just simplify it and play football. Get the in form and best players in. Motivate them , make them fight for everything. Have a effing Plan B for god’s sake when plan A goes down the crapper. Stop making excuses. Stop picking Romero, despite the fact that he seems to have dirty pictures of practically all our coaches, past , present or future.</p><p>Hell , if Portugal, with Luis “I have an IQ of an ostrich” Nani can win a cup, so CAN WE .</p><p>Vick out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilpaOxsK3Lm6CcnZyawLWxjZympmdiZX53e49xZmlrX5Z6rbvOpGSbmZOgeqK%2Bxp6lraGelnqiwIxrZ2lwXaS5urnPopqsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
