Johnson and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Hart</a></strong> have shown a chemistry on screen that fans seem to truly enjoy.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>It could be that Johnson has an allure all his own anyway, and Hart knows how to draw in gobs of fans — and that’s what makes their pairing so natural (or a moneymaker).</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Or it could be that they’ve only scratched the surface on what could become of two of the hardest working people in Hollywood when they put their stature and stardom together.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>In reality, they’ve only been buddy-buddy for real in three movies — two of those being jungle-themed.</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>Yet after this year, they will have appeared in five total movies together, with a sixth on the slate, and maybe more.</p><p data-characters=55 data-current-count=55 data-injectable=false>What does the world think of the two teaming up so far?</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>According to box office receipts, the feeling are pretty favorable.</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>Let’s run through all the Kevin Hart and The Rock movies, ranked, of course.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-fast-furious-presents-hobbs-shaw-2019 data-injectable=false>4. <strong>Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>It’s a Johnson-led film with merely a cameo from Hart. Though it’s a good one — being that the movie isn’t centered around the two — for this ranking, it has to come in last, regardless.</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>You do get the dual joy of having Ryan Reynolds pop up alongside Hart in their cameos.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>We have Reynolds playing CIA agent Victory Locke as well as Hart as Air Marshall Dinkley, and couldn’t you just mix and match those two along with Johnson and have about a 72% success rate? (Remember, Reynolds and Johnson starred in Netflix’s Red Notice, which didn’t receive great critical acclaim yet somehow shot up the ranks of streaming viewership all the same).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=45 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Now, bring those two (three, four) together!</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Maybe, just maybe, it’s a set up for Hobbs & Shaw & Dinkley & Locke?</p><p data-characters=16 data-current-count=16 data-injectable=false>We’re into it!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>3. Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>The pretty successful sequel to the ultra-successful reboot/sequel.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>As Central Intelligence did, the movie relies way too much on the audience just liking Hart and Johnson (as well as Jack Black and Karen Gillan). Sure, it’s a safe bet, as the first Jumanji flm featuring the foursome was fun and made boatloads of money.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>However, the classic pitfall of sequels befalls this film as well, without enough originality, storyline, and the general lack of things to truly care about making you walk away from the movie not disappointed, but not impressed.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>All the bits for a sequel are here from famous side characters and cameos (Danny Glover, Rhys Darby, Colin Hanks, Danny DeVito) to rehashing setups from the first film.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>You could do worse than popping this on brainlessly to stream when you don’t want to cycle through the recommended lists anymore, but you could (and they could) do better.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>Then again, the movie made three-quarters of a billion dollars ($800M+) and a third film with this cast is already in the works.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>We sometimes forget that laughs plus special effects with a side of emotion are plenty enough for a full watch these days and throughout the decades, that hasn’t gone out of style. Isn’t that the whole premise of Top Gun: Maverick anyway?</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Hopefully they work on bringing something else to life rather than a third helping of what we already had (*cough* Jurassic World: Dominion *cough*).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>2. Central Intelligence (2016)</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=32 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>A little Hart and a big Johnson.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Literally, the tagline on the poster goes as tongue-in-cheek as possible while stating the literal stature of the two stars.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>So the stars don’t come up with the movie poster tagline, but still, their first movie together laid the groundwork for their collaborations yet to come.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>You’d hope the premise goes beyond that, but, it’s about what you expect.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Take two guys who get along and buddy cop them up.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>Whenever a movie quadruples its budget, it catches attention (mostly from the ones making the money), with Central Intelligence sporting a budget of $50 million while earning more than $215 million worldwide.</p><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=117 data-injectable=false>You get fans of Hart drawn in, you get Johnson’s immense audience brought into the fray, and boom — it’s a hit.</p><p data-characters=29 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false>That’s the problem, though.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>With a better script, better direction, better cinematography, creativity, and so on and so forth, this movie goes from solid to incredible.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>However, they still rely way too much on the duo’s chemistry to bring things home instead of plotting anything resembling a great script and storyline.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>The level of self-deprecation and wit both actors have — and their ability to bring humor to great scenes — isn’t really to be found here.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>You’ll laugh, and enjoy the film, but you won’t come away from it with memorable scenes from a great team up, as you do in something like Step Brothers.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Sometimes, it pays to just play the hits and tune out, I suppose.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>It shows something in this day and age of any remotely successful film that spawns a sequel when it hasn’t been marked for a part two, because the promise of what this could have been is what makes it fall so short.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=114 data-injectable=false>If you can set aside expectations, and you enjoy a little Hart or a big Johnson, then for sure this is worth a go.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>1. Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle (2017)</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>Technically the sequel to the original Robin Williams venture, but something totally different: the rare reboot and sequel all in one.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>It’s tough to say if this movie is great because we didn’t see it coming or if it’s just great because it’s actually a super solid movie.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>People behaving strangely because they’ve inhabited a different body or form or avatar is golden humor. Body switching movies have spanned decades now, and this takes it over the top thanks to a crew who can do just that.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>We get the “original” foursome as their high school selves and the four actors take great care to embody those traits and mannerisms, while taking them to another level.</p><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Maybe Face/Off 2 can do some sort of virtual face swapping and pull off the same effect?</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>In Welcome to the Jungle, Black, Hart, Gillan, and Johnson all do their characters and their avatar characters great justice here.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>It just about made a cool billion worldwide, getting all the way to $962 million, so no wonder it’s a soon-to-be reboot trilogy.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>Johnson gets to be strong yet sensitive, humorous and caring, which is basically the pillars of his characters in nearly every film.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Hart gets to be funny, insightful, awkward, on the verge of cringeworthy but somehow never getting there, and passionate. Again, kinda like the Hart we successfully see in many of his movies, too.</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Add them together with the zany and heartfelt Black doing his thing and Gillan perfectly playing shyness in one vain and a newfound extrovert in another and you’ve got yourself a hit.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>Up next (2022 and beyond)</strong></h3><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Later this year we get both actors as the main bill in DC League of Super-Pets. The poster only boasts Hart and Johnson at the top and though we won’t get them on the screen, both have experience doing great work with animation and voiceover — Hart in The Secret Life of Pets and Captain Underpants, and Johnson in Moana.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>Johnson is playing Superman’s dog, Krypto, and Hart will be Batman’s dog, Ace, which already seems like a better premise than Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice wound up being.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Even with the two taking top billing, the movie doesn’t lack in its supporting cast with Keanu Reeves, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Middleditch, Kate McKinnon, Ben Schwartz, John Krasinski, and Vanessa Bayer all part of the crew too.</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>After that, we’ll most likely see them pairing up again in a third Jumanji film.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>For those that watched both Jumanji’s, the scene during the credits of The Next Level set us up for the next film to come and for the cast to expand. Audiences are even in for a treat with some call-backs or crossovers with the original film starring Robin Williams.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>Perhaps both Hart and Johnson will learn what they truly have beyond just improvising and getting to be in the same film together and can take a project to a new level — one that brings about the unique quality bubbling just below the surface in all the films above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXaCyt7XNZp%2BaqqRirq%2BwjK2fnmWipLCsecyoraKdo2K%2ForrKnpto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
