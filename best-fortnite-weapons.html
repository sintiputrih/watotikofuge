Building a loadout that suits your playstyle and managing your inventory as the match progresses is key to snagging a win. You don’t want to be caught in a long-range battle against someone on a mountaintop without a solid rifle on hand, and you certainly don’t want to find yourself inside a close-quarters building without an SMG or shotgun.</p><p>Our guide to the best weapons in Fortnite breaks down rarity types and what they mean, the most effective arms in each weapon category, and tips for how to use them. Chapter 4, Season 2 brought a lengthy list of changes to the Fortnite arsenal — including new weapons and the return of some fan favorites.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about the best weapons in Fortnite.</p><p><strong>Recommended reading:</strong></p><h2>Weapon colors and what they mean</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>Fortnite’s selection of weapons varies between categories, with plenty of different arms to choose from. From the Combat SMG to the Striker Burst Rifle, there’s something to fit every play style. Each weapon is assigned a tier on a rarity scale, too. Whether you’re selecting an SMG or an assault rifle, all weapons will be color-coded as such:</p><ul><li><strong>Gray:</strong> Common</li><li><strong>Green:</strong> Uncommon</li><li><strong>Blue:</strong> Rare</li><li><strong>Purple:</strong> Epic</li><li><strong>Orange:</strong> Legendary</li><li><strong>Gold:</strong> Mythic</li></ul><p>The rarer the gun, the more damage it will do (typically). There are some exceptions to this, but if this is the case, a weapon will likely have a faster fire rate or other ability that still improves its overall damage per second (DPS). Keep this in mind when entering an engagement with another player, especially during later portions of a match. You likely won’t survive using a common rifle against a player using a rare one.</p><p>If at any time during the game, you find a higher rarity tier of the weapon you’re currently using, make sure you swap out your current weapon and pick up the better color. This allows you to make sure you are maximizing your damage. Gray and green weapons are fine at the start of the match, but you should have at least blue ones by the time half of the players are eliminated.</p><p>Choosing between weapons types is more difficult. It might not be a good idea to trade a common assault rifle for an epic pistol if you know you’re about to cover some open terrain. If you have to make such a choice, think about where you plan to head next and what weapon is best suited to the terrain. Not skilled with a sniper rifle? Don’t waste the inventory space by picking it up, even if it’s legendary.</p><h2>The best guns in Fortnite during Chapter 4, Season 2</h2><p>While simply stumbling upon any weapon is preferable to running around the Fortnite map wildly swinging your pickax, there are some firearms that are better than others. For instance, you should really hope you happen upon an SMG over a pistol. Likewise, you’ll need an assault rifle or sniper for those firefights that occur across long distances. The general rule of thumb is to ensure you have weapons for any situation, from close quarters to midrange and beyond.</p><p>Below are the best weapons in the game currently.</p><h3>Kinetic Blade</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The new Kinetic Blade is practically required if you want to rack up wins — but not for the reasons you might think. While the weapon itself is decent and deals 60 damage with each swipe (which can be enough to finish many close-range engagements), the main reason to use the Kinetic Blade is for its traversal purposes.</p><p>You can use the Kinetic Blade to zip around the map quickly and even get the drop on unsuspecting opponents. It’s akin to the Nimbus Cloud from previous seasons, as it allows you to traverse the map very quickly. For that reason, it’s an essential part of the weapon meta during Chapter 4, Season 2.</p><h3>Cobra DMR</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Fittingly, the Cobra DMR is a variation of the standard DMR, excelling at long-range encounters with the ability to take down opponents in just a handful of shots. This is the perfect long-range weapon, offering the qualities of a sniper but without many of the downsides. With the Cobra DMR, you can zoom in with plenty of magnification, and thanks to its semi-auto firing style, you can pull off follow-up shots in quick succession. The Cobra DMR has more ammo and shoots faster than the standard DMR, making it far more forgiving.</p><p>While the DMR doesn’t deal as much damage as a sniper, it’s far easier to use thanks to its fast rate of fire. Depending on the rarity and whether you hit the head, the Cobra DMR deals anywhere from 36 to 69 damage per shot, meaning you can eliminate a player (with full health) in four to seven shots. This is a big deal, especially if you can pull off a few shots before your opponents know where you are, making it a great long-range weapon. Sure, other rifles might be a little easier to use, but when it comes to power and precision, the Cobra DMR is the standout winner.</p><p>The Cobra DMR was removed in Chapter 3, but has made a return during Chapter 4, Season 2 as an unvaulted weapon.</p><h3>Heisted Blink Mag SMG</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Heisted Blink Mag SMG is a top choice, though, it’s difficult to obtain. This is essentially a version of the Twin Mag SMG, but in Exotic form. You obtain it by defeating the Double Agent Hush boss found in Mega City. The reason it’s so effective is that it deals 21 damage per shot and has an extremely high rate of fire, meaning its overall DPS is around 273. If you pull off a headshot, you’ll deal around 31 damage. The other factor to consider is that the Heisted Blink Mag SMG is hitscan, meaning you won’t have to lead your shots with it. It’s great for close and mid-range battles, meaning it’s an essential part of your loadout.</p><h3>Havoc Pump Shotgun</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Speaking of close range, we highly recommend the Havoc Pump Shotgun for those fights within 10 meters or so. This weapon, as expected, hits hard, dealing anywhere from 108 to 144 damage depending on rarity. However, the Mythic version can deal up to 250 damage, meaning it can down an opponent in one shot. Despite its power, it’s quite unforgiving if you miss with it, since its fire rate and reload speeds are so slow. With that in mind, we suggest only using it within that 10-meter range, as you’ll be at a disadvantage beyond that.</p><h3>Havoc Suppressed Assault Rifle</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Finally, you’ll need an assault rifle for those mid to long-range battles, and none are better than the Havoc Suppressed Assault Rifle. This is a highly accurate, and rapid-firing assault rifle that packs a punch. It deals anywhere from 21 to 37 damage with each shot depending on rarity and whether you hit the head, meaning it’ll take seven to 12 hits to down an enemy with full plates. Given its fast fire rate, this means you can take down your foes extremely quickly, provided you can control the weapon. We advise using this between 25 to 40 meters.</p><h2>Best guns in each class</h2><h3>Assault rifles</h3><p>While assault rifles aren’t the most powerful set of guns in the game, they’re the most versatile. You’ve got several variants with different kinds of stopping power. They won’t take out enemies from across the map, but you’re easily covered whether you need to make a quick getaway to safety or you’re going on a run for your Victory Royale with five people left standing in your way. Just make sure to fire in short bursts, and you’ll be golden.</p><p>The best assault rifles are as follows:</p><ul><li>Havoc Suppressed Assault Rifle</li><li>Red-Eye Assault Rifle</li></ul><h3>Shotguns</h3><p>Shotguns aren’t great at range, of course, but if someone is nearby, you can rock their world with a devastating shotgun blast. They are the perfect complement to your assault rifle. Some are notably better than others, so play around to find the one that suits you best. You’ll find different categories of shotguns to choose from in the form of pump shotguns, tactical shotguns, and lever-action shotguns. The tactical shotgun is currently the best choice for players looking for a high rate of fire.</p><p>The best shotguns are as follows:</p><ul><li>Havoc Pump Shotgun</li><li>Heisted Accelerant Shotgun</li></ul><h3>SMGs</h3><p>While not as powerful or as direct as assault rifles or shotguns, SMGs are still preferable in battle when you need something quick and light to eliminate the competition. They’re automatic, so you can hold the trigger down in a panic, and they’ll hold plenty of ammo.</p><p>They won’t do as much damage as assault rifles or shotguns, but they’re like little firecrackers that can still make for quite the party when people come to try and mess with you. Many players underrate the SMG, but it can entirely wreck a shotgun player at close range, especially if you take advantage of that weapon’s delay in shots and frequent reload time.</p><p>Here are the best SMGs:</p><ul><li>Heisted Blink Mag SMG</li><li>Heisted Run N’ Gun SMG</li></ul><h3>Sniper rifles</h3><p>Let’s face it: Not everyone can excel as a sniper. But if a sniper rifle is all you can find, use it wisely. It will require you to constantly remain on the move and on the lookout for areas in-game where you can sit and wait for passersby to pick off, but you’ll be a force to be reckoned with while hidden. These weapons can one-shot kill anyone who gets in your way with a well-placed headshot.</p><p>The best sniper is as follows:</p><ul><li>Heavy Sniper Rifle</li></ul><h3>Pistols</h3><p>Most pistols do meager damage, though they can be deadly when you find the right ones. They’re just a lot slower, rarely automatic, and do less damage per shot than most other weapons. Still, a pistol is better than nothing. Epic Games has added some pretty impressive pistols in the last couple of months, though only one is commonly available during Chapter 4, Season 2.</p><p>Here is the best pistol:</p><ul><li>Tactical Pistol</li></ul><h3>Explosives and special weapons</h3><p>As part of Chapter 4, Season 2, there aren’t many explosives and special weapons to choose from — at least ones that are practical or common. Throughout past seasons, special weapons have typically been overpowered, gimmicky, or not as useful as you’d expect. Epic Games has prioritized making the traditional weapon pool more varied and effective, such as the SMGs, assault rifles, snipers, and shotguns. Still, this season features the Grapple Glove, which is a useful method of getting around the map. Likewise, the Shockwave Grenade is a highly effective tool for putting distance between you and your opponents.</p><p>Below are the recommended explosives and special weapons:</p><ul><li>Firefly Jar</li><li>Grenade</li></ul><p>All of these recommended weapons work best for us, but ultimately, your favorite firearms will come down to preference, at least partially. If a weapon doesn’t feel good, you probably won’t like using it, no matter how much damage it deals.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfnK6utc2gZpudo6l6p7vRraWirJVixKatz6ilrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
