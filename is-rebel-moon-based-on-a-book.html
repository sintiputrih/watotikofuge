The slightly longer answer is “no, but calling it an original concept isn’t exactly honest, either.” The even longer answer than that is “It’s an amalgamation of a bunch of other people’s ideas, thinly coated in Zack Snyder-brand varnish and presumably run past a bunch of intellectual property experts to make super, duper sure that none of this is actionable.”</p><p data-characters=716 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>It’s no secret that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebel Moon&nbsp;has its roots in&nbsp;Star Wars</a>.&nbsp;Before finding a forever home on the streaming service, the two-part Netflix film, which hits theaters Nov. 15, 2023, started life as a pitch for a Snyder-style, just-for-big-boys addition to George Lucas’ galaxy a long, long way off. Unfortunately for Snyder, talks with Lucasfilm fell apart when the company was purchased, Kitt Fisto and Kaboodle Fisto, by the good folks at Disney. Disney’s higher-ups didn’t cotton to Snyder’s ideas, and a&nbsp;Heavy Metal, Magazine-inspired Jedi epic was left forever unrealized, leaving ample space for memorable entries to the franchise like&nbsp;Solo: A Star Wars Story&nbsp;and that show about Obi-Wan being sad.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>All of that being said, after a long process of shopping the project around as a movie, TV show, and video game, Rebel Moon remained, down to its DNA, a Star Wars movie. It’s not ashamed to say it, either: This is a heavily inspired homage to the sci-fi throwbacks from the ‘70s and ‘80s. It just has more swearing and, in all likelihood, a fully exposed butt.</p><p data-characters=1135 data-current-count=1135 data-injectable=false>Tangentially, of course,&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;is based on a few books. If&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;is based on&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;and&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;is based on every book that Joseph Campbell ever wrote about, then&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;is just another of a thousand faces hanging from an enigmatic hero. Shots from&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;look treacherously similar to Snyder’s previous work,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">300</a>,&nbsp;which takes direct page-to-screen visual inspiration from the comic book of the same name. Most importantly,&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;is, inescapably, a Zack Snyder project. Zack Snyder’s projects are, to a one, sopping with references to&nbsp;Excalibur,&nbsp;the adult-leaning 1981 King Arthur adaptation with blood and guts that Snyder has called “the perfect meeting of movies and mythology.” With studied dedication, he has aped&nbsp;Excalibur&nbsp;and, by extension, the writings of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the King Arthur mythos</a>&nbsp;in all of his work, and it would be genuinely bananas if it didn’t show up in his latest story. Mark my words: Carla Gugino will reprise her role from&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;as “Computer just flat out quoting&nbsp;Excalibur&nbsp;lines for a while.” I may be getting frustrated with Zack Snyder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlopqvpriMpqaopl2XrrSxw2amp2WRYq%2Bwu8po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
