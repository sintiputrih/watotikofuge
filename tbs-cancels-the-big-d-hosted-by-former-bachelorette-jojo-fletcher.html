Discovery</a>&nbsp;</strong>merger has claimed its latest victim — a reality dating series called The Big D, hosted by former Bachelorette contestants Jojo Fletcher and Jordan Rodgers, less than three weeks before it was to premiere on July 7.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=543 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>The series, which quite honestly sounds not that different from the concept of Netflix’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ultimatum</a>, takes six divorced couples and throws them into a tropical Costa Rica villa together in an attempt to re-learn how to date, all the while looking for love with other contestants in the house. There, the recent divorcees “engage in revealing relationship ex-ercises” to help them form connections with the others singles while making peace with their exes, and hopefully overcome the issues that were keeping them single.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Each episode, one divorcee who was deemed not to be “relationship material” would have been sent home, providing no shortage of drama — as exes could have potentially attempted to eliminate their competition or defend their former partner’s honor.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>The news comes just months after the announcement that new Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav would be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">axing scripted content at TNT and TBS</a> to save the company $3 billion. CNN Plus was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the first casualty of the merger</a>, having been shut down by Zaslav and his team just one month after the digital streaming platform launched. (Another scripted comedy, Kill the Orange-Faced Bear, starring Damon Wayans Jr., <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was first to go</a>, and is now being shopped around to other outlets.)</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>“We’re assessing our schedule to ensure we have the right content mix to support our network strategies,” a spokesperson for TBS said in a statement. “We are grateful to JoJo Fletcher, Jordan Rodgers, and the executive producers of Big D for their partnership through the process.”</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Both Fletcher and Rodgers, who finally wed last month nearly six years after getting engaged on season 12 of The Bachelorette in 2016, still have The Big D listed in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their respective</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram profiles</a>. The trailer is likewise still live on YouTube, which you can view below for now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1rtJmmpqmk5q5tHnToZxmmpmceqV5x6iqrZ2UYq%2B6ecWoqaadomKvoq%2FHnqOoqpWpwaZ5yaihqGWWobK1r8eeqWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
