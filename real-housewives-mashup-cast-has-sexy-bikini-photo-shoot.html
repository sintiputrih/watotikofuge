And rest assured, the comments sections on everyone’s posts were filled with love (and lots of fire emojis) from Housewives across franchises.</p>[ami-related id="1757858" url="https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/real-housewives-stars-hottest-bikini-moments-pics/" title="Melissa Gorga Promotes Envy by MG Kimono After Fighting With Joe on ‘RHONJ’" target="_blank" thumb="false" imgsrc="https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Melissa-Gorga-Promotes-Envy-by-MG-Kimono-After-Fighting-With-Joe-On-RHONJ-Promo.jpg?quality=86&amp;#038;strip=all" imgid="2001971" format="gallery" flag="" channel="33"]<p class=p1>The Real Housewives of New York City stars were among the first to first to share their sexy pictures. Singer, who enjoyed a bit of sunbathing at the house, looked truly ageless — her skincare must be working!</p><p class=p1>She wore a bright red one-piece, wide-brimmed hat, sarong and lucite heels. Newcomer to RHONY, <strong>Bershan Shaw</strong>, even jumped in the comments writing, “Yesss looking good in the best island ever.”</p><p class=p1>The countess looked equally as fab, showing off her toned figure in a little white bikini in a beach-side snap. RHONJ’s Melissa Gorga and Terea Giudice, RHOD’s <strong>D’Andra Simmons</strong> and RHOA’s Kenya Moore and Cynthia Bailey were among those to hype up de Lesseps. Our favorite comment though was from former RHONY star <a href=#><strong>Jill Zarin</strong></a>’s daughter, Ally Shapiro. She wrote, “OMG THIS BODY!!!”</p>[ami-related id="1944212" url="https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/best-celebrity-bikini-moments-of-2021-swim-style-pics/" title="Only Kate Hudson Could Make Sneakers Look Chic With a Red Bikini: Pic" target="_blank" thumb="false" imgsrc="https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Only-Kate-Hudson-Could-Make-Sneakers-Look-Chic-With-a-Red-Bikini-Pic-001.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" imgid="2015068" format="gallery" flag="" channel="33"]<p class=p1>After some fun on the beach, it looks like the girls went for a boat excursion — and the bikini photos were plentiful!</p><p class=p1>First, Real Housewives of Atlanta stars Moore and Bailey took to Instagram, wearing a white bikini and black one-piece respectively. And we have to give a special mention to Bailey’s multicolored box braids!</p><p class=p1>Next, RHOBH’s Richards struck a pose on the boat, showing off her insanely fit figure (and amazing jaw line!) in a multi-colored black bikini.</p><p class=p1>Fellow castmates <a href=#><strong>Dorit Kemsely</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> and newcomer <strong>Crystal Kung Minkoff</strong> popped into the comments. Plus, she got the ultimate stamp of approval from former RHONY star <a href=#><strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong></a>, who wrote: “HOT stuff.”</p><p class=p1>The final photo came from RHONY’s Melissa Gorga, who looked unreal in a hot pink Versace bikini.
