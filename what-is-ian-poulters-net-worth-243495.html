Here, we take a look at his net worth and how much money he has accumulated in his near 30 year professional career.</p><h2 id=video-things-you-didn-apos-t-know-about-ian-poulter-3>VIDEO: THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IAN POULTER</h2><p>We begin with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/gear/gear-news/ian-poulter-whats-in-the-bag-2-153628>Poulter's</a> winnings which, on the PGA Tour, sit around the $28.5 million mark. Currently, he features in the top 40 on the PGA Tour money list, with the Englishman also inside the top 10 of the DP World Tour career money list, securing over €27 million.</p><p>In 2022, he was announced as one of the players to jump ship to LIV Golf, with it being reported that <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2022/02/01/saudi-arabia-offers-ian-poulter-22m-ditch-ryder-cup-join-rebel/?utm_content=sport&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1643729434">Poulter had been offered</a> between $20-$30 million to join. Playing all eight events, he picked up around $3 million in total and is scheduled to play the 14-tournament series in 2023.</p><p>Along with competing, Poulter has staged his own tournament previously. In 2015, he was the official host of the British Masters at Woburn, a European Tour event. He also held the IJP Junior Invitational there, which ran from 2006 to 2015.</p><figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/ian-poulter-car-collection>In an interview with GQ magazine Poulter said</a>: “Growing up, all I wanted was a nice car. It equated to doing well. I won the Italian Open, and I thought: ‘Right, time to buy a Ferrari.’ But once I’d paid my caddy and the tax, it didn’t leave enough for one. I won the Moroccan Open in 2001, and the cheque from that didn’t quite stretch to a Ferrari. But my third victory, the Italian Open again, I thought it was an omen, and I headed straight to Maranello concessionaires in Egham and picked up a Rosso Corsa Ferrari 360 Modena.”</p><p>Poulter now owns several Ferraris and has created a motor museum at his home in Lake Nona, Orlando, Florida. Among his collection are two Ferrari LaFerraris. This particular Ferrari model can fetch between $4.5 to $7 million at auction depending on mileage and condition.</p><p>Throughout his career, the Englishman has been one of the most marketable golfers on the planet, with his previous sponsors including NetJets and Mastercard, who had sponsored him since 2009 before dropping <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/ian-poulters-caddie-161933>Poulter</a> due to his decision to join LIV Golf.</p><p>According to his website, he is the Touring Professional of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/courses/top-100-courses/woburn-golf-club-marquess-course-review-60755>Woburn Golf Club</a> and has been since 2003. Poulter is also sponsored by OKX, a cryptocurrency exchange with advanced financial services and Recast, which is a subscription-free streaming platform.</p><p>At the 2023 HSBC Abu Dhabi Golf Championship, he was pictured without the Audemars Piguet logo, but it is unclear as to whether they have split or not.</p><p>The last point to mention is his IJP Design clothing business which was set up in 2006. It lasted for 11 years, with the Englishman closing it in 2017, explaining that: “We have been unable to justify its continuation after many years of investing in the business and a number of attempts to reshape it against an ever increasingly competitive landscape.”</p><p>Today's Best Deals On Ian Poulter Gear</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvLn6SopqSdubp6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZq2glWK0ornEaK6hmaRitrR5yJqlZqifqrm1sdGsZKedpGLEsL7ToWRrbGNphnY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
