Joseline had uploaded a photo of herself topless by the pool, and Tory sat behind her, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">cupping her breasts</a>. Definitely a couple-type shot. Then, she&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">bid adieu to him</a> as he left on tour for a few weeks. Another relevant piece of evidence. All in all, it seemed pretty safe to assume that there was something going on between the two of them. However, reports were incorrect as Joseline just took to Twitter to deny that she's dating Tory Lanez and that they're just friends.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">From the sounds of it, Tory was either just friend-zoned hard or there was nothing there to begin with and they were just trolling. The reality star added, "Can 2 young rich sexy talented people hangout and have fun without the world assuming anything. Smh. I’m allow&nbsp;[sic] to have friends without y’all making it bigger than life." Of course, two people are allowed to chill without having a spotlight shone on them but when breast-cupping is involved, it's a little difficult to believe that there's not an underlying relationship going on. Regardless, it seems as though Tory and Joseline are just friends, having fun as a few rich, young hoodlums in this world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhaoJ3gY9moairlaG2r7GMoZyrppGjsabGjJ2cp6GVqHq1u9GyZKWZnprHbrLLoqWgZZGbwaa%2BjJupnpmjqXqkwc%2BpoKefXaW1sMDOZqWer6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
