Connecticut state police confirmed to <a href=#>Page Six</a> that the 28-year-old was driving along on I-91 in her Mini Cooper Countryman around 1 a.m. when she "stopped in the center lane" and an oncoming truck "was unable to stop in time and impacted the rear" of her car.&nbsp;Eric B.'s daughter was transported to Hartford Hospital after the event, while the driver of the truck didn't have any injuries. "Investigators are still piecing together the exact cause of the crash," Sister 2 Sister 2.0 <a href=#>reported</a> before Erica's passing. "Barrier is suffering from severe neck and spine fractures, among her many life-threatening injuries. The family is at her bedside and asking for your prayers."</p><p>Eric B. didn't reveal further details surrounding the crash, although he did have a message for the other driver. "This was an unfortunate vehicular accident that claimed her life, however, and it's also crucial that we pray for the other driver involved," he said in a statement to&nbsp;Sister 2 Sister 2.0 (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Page Six</a>).&nbsp;"Our hearts also go out to him and his family as we hold no ill will in our hearts for those involved."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanFlZoN1e8eip2agn6V6rbHGnqWdZZWntqR5wWaqZpyRqrSpwMSrZJ2hlah6osCMmp6eZWJtfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
