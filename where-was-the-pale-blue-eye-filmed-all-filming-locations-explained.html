He is known for novels such as The Black Tower, Jackie & Me, and Roosevelt’s Beast. Writer and director Scott Cooper brought Bayard’s story to life in film, which is now out on <a href=#>Netflix</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=718 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>As the thriller unfolds, more cadets are discovered with organs missing from their bodies. The mystery includes several twists and the setting of the movie plays a pivotal role, so the director needed to find the perfect location to bring the nation’s oldest military academy, and its surrounding community, to life. Since West Point is home to more than 4,500 cadets and has changed significantly since the early 1800s, they needed to find alternate locations. The movie was filmed in Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, an area they could find that could resemble West Point in the 1800s. Since the Ligonier Township Village of Laughlintown has a historic appeal, a majority of the movie was filmed in the area.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>West Point</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pale-Blue-Eye.png><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>Of course, you can’t have a movie set at a historic college without actually showing something that resembles what it could have looked like during that timeframe. To help emulate the look and feel of the old university, they used <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Westminster College</a> in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania. With just a few modifications – such as wagons and cannons added – the film’s version of the USMC was created.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>West Point Barracks</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/US-Military-Academy-1.png><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hartwood Acres Park</a> is a historic estate that was originally designed for an equestrian family.

The 16th century style Tudor mansion called the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hartford Estate Mansion</a> was designed by Alfred Hopkins for John and Mary Flinn Lawrence and includes 31 rooms that gave the film crew plenty of space to film.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Benny’s Haven</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bennys-Haven-1.png><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>In the 1960s, the Ligonier Valley Historical Society restored the former stagecoach hostelry <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Compass Inn</a> and opened it up to the public as a museum. Since the building was originally built in 1799, the look of the building was the perfect location to bring Benny’s Haven to life in the film.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Jean Pepe’s home</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jean-Pepes-house-2.png><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>A West Point professor and occult expert named Jean Pepe’s (Robert Duvall) home is the setting for several scenes. The scenes were filmed at Penguin Court, 1,100-acres of land that gained its name because it used to be home to penguins that would roam the land. The land is now part of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brandywine Conservancy</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>The Hanging Tree</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Hanging-Tree-1.png><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Filmed on the shores of Lake Arthur just between Barber Point Beach and Lakeview Beach in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moraine State Park</a>, this location serves as not only a stand-in for the actual Hudson River that borders West Point but also as a stark and brightly lit contrast to the movie’s many other gloomily lit scenes. A stark contrast that ironically highlights the site’s purpose in the film.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Funeral Scene</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cemetary-2.png><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>Perhaps foreshadowing Poe’s later career as America’s first major horror writer, he takes a stroll through a cemetery with Lucy Boynton’s Lea Marquis. The location used for Pale Blue Eye, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Allegheny Cemetery</a> is a located bit further down the East coast in Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville neighborhood. Several other scenes for the film, including the funeral of Cadet Leroy Fry were shot there.</p><h2 id=h-the-ice-house data-injectable=false><strong>The Ice House</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Icehouse-1.png><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=false>The ice house, where Bale’s Constable Landor discovers the macabre signs of occult rituals is the actual historic McConnells Mill located in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McConnells Mill State Park</a>.
