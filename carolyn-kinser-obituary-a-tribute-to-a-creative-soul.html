She died at the University of Louisville Hospital, leaving a legacy of love, generosity, and faith. Carolyn grew up in Jefferson County and was deeply involved. She was the daughter of Howard and Josephine Jones Humphrey and lived by their principles. Carolyn was a homemaker whose life revolved around her family. Lifelong participation at Red Hill General Baptist Church, where she found comfort, companionship, and spiritual fulfillment, showed her deep faith. Her steadfast faith inspired everyone she knew.</p><p>Carolyn was a loving wife to the late Darrel Dane Kinser Sr., and their relationship was envied. She loved her daughters Sherri Stettler and Tammy Kinser and son Darrel Dane Kinser Jr. Her unfailing love and support gave her children strength throughout their lives. Carolyn leaves her five grandkids, Darrel Dane Kinser III, Shawn Matthew Kinser, Eric Joseph Kinser, Robert Wayne Stettler Jr., and Rex Andrew Needham, to her immediate family. Carolyn loved her grandchildren unconditionally and was so proud of them. Carolyn’s eight great-grandchildren will hear her love and devotion. They will be inspired and guided by her memory as they navigate life.</p><p>Carolyn’s funeral will be held at Red Hill General Baptist Church at 2:30 PM on Monday, followed by burial in the church cemetery. The church will have visitation on Sunday from 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM and Monday after 10:00 AM. Gravil Funeral Home is handling arrangements. We grieve Carolyn Humphrey Kinser but celebrate her life of love, faith, and family. Her presence will be missed, but her spirit will live on in everyone who knew her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwr8CrpqWxnmK4qrrSnqlmp5Kewbat0bJkmmWkp7ajwdOeZK2nXZZ6pL7EmquirpViwLDBy2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
