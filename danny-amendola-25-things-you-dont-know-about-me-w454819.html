New England Patriots wide receiver <b>Danny Amendola</b>, who is currently dating former Miss USA <b>Olivia Culpo</b>, shares 25 interesting facts about himself with <i>Us Weekly</i>.</p><p>1. My favorite color is black.</p><p>2. My go-to travel destination is really just any beach; I’m not picky.</p><p>3. I have six scars from either reckless childhood fun or football-related surgeries.</p><p>4. A lot of people take extra pillows off of their beds when they go to sleep. I am the opposite — I want as many as I can find.</p><p>5. My all-time favorite TV show is <i>Married With Children</i>.</p><p>6. I can’t live without my Bose headphones and Ray Ban sunglasses.</p><p>7. I am a weekend warrior all-star at table tennis.</p><p>8. My go-to pregame meal is a peanut butter and Nutella sandwich on wheat.</p><p>9. I’ve only really had one big “fan” moment with a celebrity. It was when I first met <b>Ben Affleck</b>. We were both at an event in LA, and just as I was working up the courage to go introduce myself, he actually recognized me. Turns out that Ben is a big Patriots fan — it was great.</p><p>10. It’s tough to pick one favorite thing about Boston, but their food culture is incredible — Italian, Portuguese, seafood, a classic steakhouse… It’s all here.</p><p>11. I have two favorite candies – Sour Patch Kids and Snickers.</p><p>12. My favorite person to follow on Twitter is <a href=#><b>Conor McGregor</b></a>.</p><p>13. The best concert I’ve ever attended was at Bonnaroo. My Morning Jacket was the band; they rocked the house.</p><p>14. If I were not an NFL player, I would be a Hollywood stuntman.</p><p>15. My favorite family memory was driving from Texas to Boston. I was 8 and my brother, <b>Matt</b>, would have been 13. It took us three-and-a-half days to get there and we played pranks on my parents the entire way; it was very <i>National Lampoon</i>. They would probably have a different family memory in mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/danny-amendola-inline-da814b1e-3bf5-4d1f-bb4c-3d08ddc16f4a.jpg><p><span>16. My middle school crush was </span><b>Carmen Electra</b><span>.</span></p><p>17. I collected Matchbox cars when I was a kid. I probably had about 100 and would race them on different tracks. My favorite cars were <b>Dale Earnhardt</b> and <b>Richard Petty</b>.</p><p>18. I established the Danny Amendola Catches for Kids Foundation in 2010 to support and provide resources for low-income children and families. Both of my parents were teachers, so the importance of a good education has always been a high priority for me. We have donated software and hardware to learning centers with Autodesk, provided backpacks, school supplies and clothing to students with Walmart, and opened three Catch a Book reading rooms with Scholastic throughout the greater Boston area.</p><p>19. My first car was a 1992 red Mercury Tracer.</p><p>20. My childhood nickname was Squeaky because I had a high voice when I was younger. I had it up until about middle school.</p><p>21. My cheat meal is a fried chicken sandwich on a fresh, homemade biscuit with honey butter.</p><p>22. My first job was at a batting cage.</p><p>23. The first concert I attended was for Blink 182.</p><p>24. The best thing about football is the locker room after a win. Nothing comes close to that atmosphere.</p><p>25. My all-time favorite football memory is catching a touchdown in Super Bowl XLIX and celebrating with that incredible team afterward.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ6jxm6tzJ6lnaeclnpzgYytn6Kml6h6urvUZpuopqRiuK%2B71maYm6elqXqusYywa25saGaGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
