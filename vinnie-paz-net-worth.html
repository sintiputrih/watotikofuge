In addition to this, Paz is a member of the hip hop group Army of the Pharaohs. Vinnie has been active in the entertainment industry since 1993.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Vinnie Paz? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth is as much as $1 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2016. Music is the main source of Paz’s modest fortune.</p><h3>Vinnie Paz Net Worth $1 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Luvinieri and his family moved to and he grew up in Clifton Heights, a small community in Delaware County, Pennsylvania in the USA. There he was educated as a Roman Catholic, but as an adult converted to Islam.</p><p>Concerning his professional career, he began as a rapper under the pseudonym Ikon the Verbal Hologram in 1991, but he later changed his nickname to the current – Vinnie Paz, taken from the boxer Vinny Paz. His style is influenced by the music of artists like MC Freshco & DJ Miz, Tuff Crew, Hilltop Hustlers, Steady B, EPMD, Gang Starr, Lord Shafiq and Cool C. He is also a fan of heavy metal.</p><p>Together with his childhood friend Stoupe The Enemy of Mankind, he founded the group Jedi Mind Tricks in 1993, with Paz contributing his well-known rough and metallic voice that emphasizes his often very aggressive and socially critical lyrics. The usual topics of the rapper are such as religion, war, politics, mythology, conspiracy and paranormal issues. The partly gloomy style came through on the Jedi Mind Tricks album “Violent by Design” (2000), which did not enter the Billboard charts yet sold 50,000 albums the first week; all the following albums released by Jedi Mind Tracks entered Billboard charts, with the fifth studio album “Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell” (2006) topping the Billboard Top Heatseekers. Recently, together with the band Paz released the studio album “The Thief and the Fallen” (2015) which topped the Heatseekers Albums chart.</p><p>It should be noted that Paz has also been active as a part of the band Army of the Pharaohs. They have released five studio albums, of which two – “The Torture Papers” (2006) and “In Death Reborn” (2014) – entered the Billboard charts.</p><p>As a solo artist Vinnie Paz has been active since 2009, and has released three albums – “Season of the Assassin” (2009), “God of the Serengeti” (2012) (topped the Billboard Top Heatseekers) and “The Cornerstone of the Corner Store” (2016). As an adjunct, Vinnie Paz has launched the independent record label entitled Enemy Soil.</p><p>In conclusion, all the above mentioned ventures have increased the total size of Vinnie Paz’s net worth.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the hip hop artist, Paz keeps his life private and does not reveal anything concerning relationships. However, rumours have been flying that he is gay – Vinnie does not confirm or deny this.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.627962085308><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Vinnie Paz</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 5, 1977</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Agrigento, Italy</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.71&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>77&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Record producer, Rapper</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Vincenzo Luvineri , Ikon the Verbal Hologram</td></tr><tr readability=0.39024390243902><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/vinniepaz</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/vinnie_paz</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2584326</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.29090909090909><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/vinnie-paz-mn0000184652</a></td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>The Grimy Awards</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Record Labels</td><td>Babygrande Records, Enemy Soil</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Albums</td><td>"Servants in Heaven Kings in Hell" (2006), "Violent by Design" (2000), "Violence Begets Violence" (2011), "The Thief and the Fallen" (2016), "Vinnie Paz Carry On Tradition" (EP, 2010)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Music Groups</td><td>Jedi Mind Tricks (Since&nbsp;1993), Army of the Pharaohs (Since&nbsp;1998), Heavy Metal Kings (Since&nbsp;2010)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>The Grimy Awards</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>The Tournament</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Heads in a Hell Basket”</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Jedi Mind Tricks: Deathless Light</td><td>2015</td><td>Short</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Composer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=composer readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Jedi Mind Tricks: Deathless Light</td><td>2015</td><td>Short</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Bad Biology</td><td>2008</td><td>associate producer</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Keep Movin' On: A Portrait of Vinnie Paz</td><td>2010</td><td>Documentary short</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Divine Fire: The Story of Jedi Mind Tricks</td><td>2009</td><td>Documentary</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bad Biology</td><td>2008</td><td></td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>ESPN Friday Night Fights</td><td>2001</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2584326_Vinnie-Paz/2584326_Bad-Biology-2008.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2584326_Vinnie-Paz/2584326_Divine-Fire-The-Story-of-Jedi-Mind-Tricks-2009.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjq%2Bgp6aZmnqxrdlmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
