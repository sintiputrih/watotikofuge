itemprop=articleBody><p><span>The entertainment industry is a true stage for the world’s talented personalities to demonstrate their God-given abilities through acts such as comedy, modeling and acting on both the small screen and the big screen.&nbsp;One amazing talent who has effortlessly successfully brought the worlds of acting and comedy together is Afro-Cuban comedian Faizon Love.&nbsp;He started his career in comedy at the age of 15 and is known for his roles in several productions such as&nbsp;</span><span>Couples Retreat, The Meteor Man, The Parenthood, The Substitutions, Blue Crush</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Friday</span><span>&nbsp;that brought him into the limelight.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Faizon Loves Bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>His date of birth is June 14, 1968 and he was born in Santiago de Cuba, the rising star spent his formative years in Newark, New Jersey as well as in San Diego, California.&nbsp;He is of Afro-Cuban descent and adopted the name Faizon Love as his stage identity, although his given name at birth is Langston Faizon Santisima.</span></p><p><span>Faizon Love is the son of a US Navy officer, so he grew up a military brat.&nbsp;However, the identities of his parents and siblings have never come to light in the media.&nbsp;For the same reason, his academic credentials have never been reported, although it is known that he attended high school in New Jersey.</span></p><p><span>The famous actor-comedian made his debut in stand-up comedy at age 15 with his first acting role at age 19 in an Off-Broadway production.</span></p><p><span>He wasted no time bagging a film role on the set of&nbsp;</span><span>Beebe’s Children</span><span>&nbsp;, which meant voicing the character for comedian Robin Harris, who passed away before production began.&nbsp;After impressing the crew with an up close impression of Harris’ voice, he landed another role in&nbsp;</span><span>The Meteor Man</span><span>&nbsp;with Robert Townsend at the helm, Robert later cast Faizon Love as the lead character in his sitcom titled&nbsp;</span><span>The Parents’</span><span>&nbsp;Hood and the Rest Is How they say story.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Faizon Love has always shown signs of being a big hit from his debut in standup comedy.&nbsp;Though his annual income has never been reported, a recent review put his net worth at an admirable $8 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Faizon Love’s wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>In contrast to his professional life, which has it all, Faizon Love’s candid relationship history remains under wraps.&nbsp;No one has access to information about their past relationships.&nbsp;While fans continue to speculate about his possible gay status as he’s still single in his early 50s, the famous actor could be officially engaged or even secretly married.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Facts about the actor and comedian</span></strong></h2><h4><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h4><p><span>While the details of his overall body measurements are unknown, the famous comedian seems to have a weight issue.&nbsp;However, his height is listed at 5 feet 10 inches or 178 cm.</span></p><h4><strong><span>Rise to glory</span></strong></h4><p><span>When he was still a high school student in New Jersey, Faizon Love was interested in performing in front of his class.&nbsp;After encouragement from his English teacher, he continued the performance.&nbsp;After graduating, he went to New York to seek work as a comedian.&nbsp;At the age of 19, Faizon had an acting role in&nbsp;</span><span>Bitter Heart Midtown</span><span>&nbsp;– an Off-Broadway production with the Harlem National Black Theatre.</span></p><p><span>After making his film debut with Robin Harris singing his voice in&nbsp;</span><span>Beebe’s Children</span><span>&nbsp;In the early 1990s, he appeared in several low-budget films such as&nbsp;</span><span>The Meteor Man</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Parents’ Hood</span><span>&nbsp;, but his portrayal of the character of Big Worm on the set of the stoner Buddy comedy popularly known as&nbsp;</span><span>Friday</span><span>&nbsp;caught his attention.</span></p><h4><strong><span>controversy</span></strong></h4><p><span>Faizon Love has a natural, outspoken personality that has often gotten him into trouble, but that hasn’t stopped him from voicing his views on subjects that pique his interest.</span></p><p><span>In 2014, he made several controversial tweets in the wake of Bill Cosby’s sexual allegations.&nbsp;Faizon threw his weight behind Cosby and used some awkward swear words as well as racial slurs for people blaming Cosby.&nbsp;In one of his tweets, he dismissed all African Americans who thought these allegations were spineless monkeys.</span></p><h4><strong><span>legal issues</span></strong></h4><p><span>Faizon Love was born in Columbus, Ohio on May 7th.&nbsp;March 2017: Alleged misdemeanor against a servant he
