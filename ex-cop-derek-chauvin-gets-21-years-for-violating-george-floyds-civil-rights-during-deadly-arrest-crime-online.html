The federal sentence will be served concurrently with the 22-year sentence he is already serving for Floyd’s second-degree murder, which is a state charge, according to the Star Tribune.</p><p>On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers were filmed arresting Floyd, 46, on suspicion that he used a counterfeit bill at the Cup Foods supermarket. After police pulled Floyd out of his car and handcuffed him, Chauvin was filmed forcing his knee into Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes.</p><p>Floyd was heard gasping for air and saying he could not breathe before he lost consciousness and died.</p><p>In February, three other former Minneapolis police officers Thomas Lane, 37, J. Alexander Kueng, 26, and Tou Thao, 34, pleaded guilty to using the “color of law” to deprive Floyd of his right to be free from the use of unreasonable force. No sentencing hearing has been scheduled.</p><p>In June, Lane — who was filmed holding down Floyd’s legs during the deadly arrest — pleaded guilty to the state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. Thao and Kueng rejected a plea deal and are still expected to stand trial in state court.</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news, subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.
