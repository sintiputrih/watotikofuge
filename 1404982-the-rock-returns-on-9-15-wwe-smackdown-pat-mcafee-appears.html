McAfee fired back by reminding Theory that SmackDown would never be his show. Instead, SmackDown belonged to the people. That cued up the surprise return of The Rock, who came out to a massive ovation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Theory tried to run his mouth, but The Rock cut him off and told him to shut his “bitch ass” up. “The Great One” said he finally came back to Denver. Theory again spoke up by saying it doesn’t matter what The Rock said. But the former world champion told him that it did matter what he said. Theory quipped that fans would finally see Rock and Austin in the ring again, but he took a shot at “Stone Cold.”‘</p><p>The Rock amped up the crowd by telling them to chant that Theory was an asshole. They did, much to Theory’s frustration. He then said he would beat Theory’s “candy ass”. Theory tried to get the advantage by attacking him. The Rock won the brief brawl and laid him out with a spinebuster. “The Brahma Bull” proceeded to hit the People’s Elbow.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>McAfee then got in on the action as he hit Theory with his own spin on The People’s Elbow.</p><p>The Rock’s appearance marked his first time live in a WWE ring since the SmackDown premiere on FOX in October 2019.
