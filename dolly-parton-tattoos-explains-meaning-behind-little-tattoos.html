However, it's not just her fondness for plastic surgery that has garnered attention.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28b9d176e641-gettyimages-1185784187-1.jpg><p id=eTvqxe8_0ZM data-wc=38>Back in 2006, Dolly attended a special edition DVD launch party for the 25th anniversary of the film, 9 to 5 – in which she starred alongside <strong>Jane Fonda</strong> and <strong>Lily Tomlin</strong> – wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebdXcAPo-9F data-wc=30>Some eagle-eyed fans spotted what appeared to be a large butterfly tattoo peeking through the top which has led to years of many people claiming Dolly is covered in ink.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7665d0c8a9f-dolly-parton-tattoos.jpg><p id=e0wjnZkEJlb data-wc=37>The 'Jolene'&nbsp;singer is never seen wearing short-sleeved tops which has only added fuel to the fire that Dolly has an extensive collection of body art. But, years later she's finally revealed whether the rumors are true.&nbsp;</p><h2>Does Dolly Parton have tattoos?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eZObW-HDMNZ data-wc=35>The short answer is yes. However, Dolly admitted in 2020 that her designs are "tasteful" and "little". "<strong>I do have some tattoos, that's true. But they're tasteful. I'm not a tattoo girl,"&nbsp;</strong>she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/347b7ca6edfe-dolly-parton-sleeveless-dress.jpg><h2>Why does Dolly Parton have tattoos?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eZQfzHmeO5 data-wc=42>Dolly admitted that she decided to get tattoos to cover up scars from previous procedures and surgeries. "My tattoos are pretty, they're artful and they usually started out to cover some scar, not to make a big statement," she explained to People.&nbsp;</p><p id=eGsaVuBP2cW data-wc=59>Elaborating further during an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">W Magazine</a> a year later, Dolly said: "<strong>Most of my tattoos came because I'm very fair and I have a tendency to scar when I get any kind of cut.&nbsp;</strong>I've had surgeries for different things, and if the scars didn't heal properly, I just gotta put tattoos to take the sting out."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1a7f1fcd809d-dolly-parton-pink-dress.jpg><h2>What tattoos does Dolly Parton have?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eYGnsDce_7 data-wc=46>Dolly did confirm that she has more than one tattoo, but she doesn't have them in typical black ink as hers are all "pastel". <strong>"I don't have the real heavy, dark tattoos. Mine are all pastel. And I have more than one!"&nbsp;</strong>she told W Magazine.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRVGHqXN60l data-wc=44>Revealing her designs, Dolly said she has bows, a beehive, ribbons, and butterflies. "Butterflies don't sting, they don't bite, and they are so beautiful," she explained. "I just kind of related to them with my own personality. I claimed them as my little symbol."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/905d74233e4a-dolly-parton-blue-dress.jpg><p id=exCR0vhJEo data-wc=57>One tattoo Dolly doesn't have though is something to symbolize her husband of 57 years, <a class=hm-link href=#>Carl Dean</a>, because "he's tattooed on [her] heart". And Dolly hasn't closed the door on getting more ink done, adding: "Who knows, I may get some later. I may just have to get covered with tattoos just so everybody could be right!"</p><p id=e35yVlRFM-9D data-wc=10><strong>See below for more photos of Dolly covering her tattoos...</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0187de31e7fe-dolly-parton-silver-fringe-dress.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d09c773a6b67-dolly-parton-performing.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e5f6c0f79aa0-dolly-parton-silver-dress.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e1d894087cd-dolly-parton-sequin-shirt.jpg><p id=eFhDl24V95 data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
