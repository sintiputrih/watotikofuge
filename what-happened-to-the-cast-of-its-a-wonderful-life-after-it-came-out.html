She is known for saying, "Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings," according to the <a href=#>National Catholic Register</a>. Grimes had already appeared in four films before landing the iconic role, she explains&nbsp;on her official website. And while she starred in 16 movies, Zuzu was her most memorable role.&nbsp;</p><p>But when Grimes was 8 years old, her mother got sick, so she had to stop acting. Her mother died of early-onset Alzheimer's when Grimes was just 14 years old. The following year, her father died in a car accident, so she moved to a small town in Missouri to live with an uncle.&nbsp;Grimes taught Bible School, and after graduating from high school became a medical technologist, a job she held for two decades. Sadly, she endured even more tragedy in her life. Her first husband, whom she had divorced, died in a hunting accident. She remarried, and her youngest child died by suicide at age 18. Her second husband died of lung cancer after 25 years of marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1990s, Grimes became an unofficial ambassador for "It's a Wonderful Life." She teamed up with several other actors from the film for a reunion tour around the United States. In 1996, she released "Zuzu Bailey's It's A Wonderful Life Cookbook." As of 2021, she still attends screenings, benefits, and conventions related to the film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCClm5rcG9frLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStoJVisKK%2F02amn2WZqcBurYywpqeclaeztriMpaCfnV2Ws7Wx0WagrWWTlrqmec6uq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
