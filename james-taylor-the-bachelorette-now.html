This was Joelle "JoJo" Fletcher's season, and James actually got pretty far in the competition, considering he didn't get eliminated until Week 7.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is James Taylor from 'The Bachelorette' now — and why was he arrested?</h2><p>A report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> confirmed that James Taylor was arrested in College Station on Sept. 10, 2022, for a DWI and unlawfully carrying a weapon. James was released the same day on a $7,000 bond. (Next time, take an Uber home from Northgate, James!) James reportedly had an unidentified 18-year-old woman with him that night.</p><p>James also made headlines back in 2021 for being officially exiled from <a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> by none other the creator of The Bachelor/The Bachelorette himself, Mike Fleiss.</p><p>The reason? James attended the <a href=#>U.S. Capitol riot</a> on Jan. 6, 2021. He thanked the conservative producers for "having my back while I legally supported our president" on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> page. A source close to ABC called James' statement "unequivocally false" in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike exiled him</a> two days later.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Whoever that former cast member/idiot jerkoff is that went to Trump’s treasonous rally, got a message for ya...

So what has the Bachelorette Season 12 alum been up to outside of the College Station/Capitol controversies?</p><p>He's still a country singer and songwriter. His latest single is titled "Great Again." Other songs in James' music catalogue include "The Way I Want You," "Texas Boy," and, "Can't Stop."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">James defended his Jan. 6 attendance at the Capitol.</h2><p>Although James has yet to publicly comment on his recent arrest, he did defend his Jan. 6 Capitol appearance. He stated in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Truth Bombs</a> interview, "Back then it wasn't supposed to be an insurrection. It was just a rally. Most of them were out there taking cell phone videos, 'Oh I got in the White House.' Was it right? No, but nobody had a gun."</p><p>James joked about the people that were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, saying, "These are the worst insurrectionists ever!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ivory Hecker (@real.ivory)</a></p></figure><p>James also stated in the same video that the FBI went to his parents' house in Katy, Texas, looking for him in 2021, even though he was transparent online about living in Atlanta at the time. The former Bachelorette contestant posts frequently about his adoration for Trump and conservative ideals on his social media pages.</p><p>So has the conservative country singer found love since JoJo broke his heart on The Bachelorette? That's currently unclear, but James posted a draft of a song on his Instagram page that he was working on in December 2021 called "You Hit Different," and noted that he couldn't wait to meet who the song was about.</p><p>Maybe James should start an unauthorized Bachelor Nation spinoff: Bachelor in Paradise: Exiled Edition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66usdJmq5qxnKS%2FbsDHnmSbmZOdsq270Z6rrZ1do7y4</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
