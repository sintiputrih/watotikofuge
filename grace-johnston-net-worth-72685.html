McClelland previously appeared in <i>Home and Away</i> as Brooke MacPherson.</p><span>2012</span><p>Hayley is Casey Braxton's (Lincoln Younes) <a href=#>Lawyer</a> and she comforts his older brother, Darryl "Brax" (Steve Peacocke), when he is sent to jail. Of Hayley and Darryl, Peacocke said "Hayley is quite cunning, because she knows he's in a bad place. She sees the opportunity to go in when he's at his low point." Darryl's on-off girlfriend, Charlie Buckton (Esther <a href=#>Anderson</a>), later sees the pair kissing and believes Darryl has moved on. Peacocke also confirmed there would be an "air of intrigue surrounding Hayley and her intentions", adding there will be a mystery as to why Hayley is in Summer Bay. Charlie becomes jealous when she sees Darryl giving Hayley a surfing lesson. The official <i>Home and Away</i> website said McClelland had to brave the elements "in a bikini on a freezing cold windy day at Palm Beach." McClelland returned to <i>Home and Away</i> as Hayley on 30 April 2012.</p><span>2013</span><p>On 4 July 2013, it was revealed Graham had finished filming on <i>Home and Away</i>. Following his on-screen departure, Graham explained that it was agreed all round "that it was time to finish Harvey" and he called his exit "harmonious". Graham admitted to staying with the show longer than he originally planned, as he was enjoying the work. He added that he would not rule out a return to <i>Home and Away</i> in the <a href=#>Future</a>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>Lists of Home and Away characters</a> <a href=#>Fictional characters introduced in 2011</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeXp66ksYyjpqGmo6m8r3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5lmttcW0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
