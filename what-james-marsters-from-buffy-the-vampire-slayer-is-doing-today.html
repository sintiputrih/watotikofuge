The movie is a "puppet horror film," per&nbsp;<a href=#>BloodyDisgusting</a>, and features Marsters in the voice of Les Hackel, the main character. The characters in the movie "will be performed by life-sized, realistic latex puppets" according to the site and <a href=#>Jordan Peele also stars</a> in the film, voicing Les' friend, Danny.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Being a voice actor or playing a puppet is not the only different medium Marsters has acted in. He was originally a theater actor, and surprisingly not a British one despite his impeccable English while appearing on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." Before he took on the role of Spike, Marsters starred in "The Tempest" in 1987 in Chicago's professional theater scene (per <a href=#>"Inside of You" podcast</a>). He was involved with a prominent Chicago theater company and moved to Seattle in 1990 to keep acting.&nbsp;</p><p>On the personal side of things, Marsters split with his wife of 10 years, Patricia Rahman, in early 2021. <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> reported that the divorce was "classified as a dissolution of marriage without minor children." Marsters has one son, Sullivan, who is in his mid-20s. Sullivan's mom is Liane Davidson, Marsters' first wife. The pair divorced in 1997 after being married for eight years. Marsters <a href=#>said at a convention</a> in 2011 that he also has a niece who he raised as a daughter starting in 2002.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamliZ4R0fY6wn5qsXZ%2BurrHSZqSaqqOpsrO%2FjJ%2BpqKVdl8Knsthmq6GdXauurrzIq5xmq5yWxqa%2BjKKqZpyfnruoedOom5qxXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
