police.</p><p>The riot happened at Abraxas Academy in Morgantown at around 8 p.m. on Sunday, the Caernarvon Township Police Department said in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>.</p><p>State and local law enforcement reported the nine offenders fled the facility after they had taken “back control of the juvenile detention center.”</p><p>Four of the teens were taken into custody around 5:45 a.m. on Monday about 5 miles away from the Abraxas Academy, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;David Beohm</a> posted on X, formally Twitter.</p><p>The remaining “escaped juveniles should be wearing gray pants or shorts and a gray shirt,” Beohm added.</p><p>State police shared they are working with Caernarvon authorities “to resolve the matter.”</p><p>A perimeter has been “established around Abraxas,” and law enforcement is asking the public to call 911 if they see someone matching the description of the teens on the run.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Law enforcement has taken back control of the juvenile detention center. <span class=credit>WPVI-TV</span></figure><p>Police are searching the area with helicopters, drones, and K9 units.</p><p>There were reports of injuries to staff members of the Academy during the riot, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC 6</a>.</p><p>It is unknown how many juveniles were involved in the riot and the extent of the damage in the facility.</p><p>The Post reached out to the Pennsylvania State Police for comment.</p><p>The Academy is 14 miles west of where&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">convicted murderer Danilo Cavalcante was found in South Coventry Township</a>&nbsp;on Wednesday after a lengthy two-week manhunt.</p><p>Abraxas Academy is described as a “multi-service facility” with a “secure” treatment program for “delinquent” males between the ages of “14 to 18 in 9th grade or above,”&nbsp;according to the facility’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website.</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Abraxas Academy had a riot earlier this summer on July 4th. <span class=credit>ABRAXAS ACADEMY</span></figure><p>“Youth are admitted to the Academy for either habitual offending behaviors or for a history of sexual offending behavior,” its website reads.</p><p>This is the facility’s second riot in less than three months, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WFMZ</a>.</p><p>On the evening of July 4th, around 50 teens had started mayhem at the detention center and had broken a water pipe, fire alarms, and “video surveillance equipment,” Trooper Beohm told the outlet following the riot.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A perimeter has been around the Academy and law enforcement is asking the public to call 911 if they see someone matching the description of the teens on the run. <span class=credit>CBS News Philadelphia</span></figure><p>“You have some kids in there that are in there for some pretty serious stuff,” Beohm said.</p><p>It took around 40 law enforcement personnel from various police departments five hours to end the July anarchy and bring the facility back to order.</p><p>“I think it could’ve been much worse for both law enforcement and those kids,” stated Beohm following the Independence Day chaos.</p><p>Two juveniles suffered minor injuries, and one staff member suffered a concussion.</p><p>Tyler Ali, a 16-year-old resident at the Academy and main instigator of the mayhem, was charged as an adult for his role in the July riot, according to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">outlet</a>.</p><p>Ali was charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, riot, disorderly conduct, and related offenses, according to Berks County District Attorney John Adams.</p><p>The Juvenile Center in Morgantown is about 49 miles northwest of Philadelphia.</p><p class=postsid
